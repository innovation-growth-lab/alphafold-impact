However, it remains unclear how the different enzymes work together to synthesize the xylan backbone. A xylan synthesis complex (XSC) has been described in the monocots wheat and asparagus, and co-expression of asparagus AoIRX9, AoIRX10 and AoIRX14A is required to form a catalytically active complex for secondary cell wall xylan biosynthesis. Here, we argue that an equivalent XSC exists for the synthesis of the primary cell wall of the eudicot Arabidopsis thaliana, consisting of IRX9L, IRX10L and IRX14. This would suggest the existence of distinct XSCs for primary and secondary cell wall xylan synthesis, reminiscent of the distinct cellulose synthesis complexes (CSCs) of the primary and secondary cell wall. In contrast to the CSC, in which each CESA protein has catalytic activity, the XSC seems to contain proteins with non-catalytic function with each component bearing potentially unique but crucial roles. Moreover, the core XSC formed by a combination of IRX9/IRX9L, IRX10/IRX10L and IRX14/IRX14L might not be stable in its composition during transit from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Instead, potential dynamic changes of the XSC might be a means of regulating xylan biosynthesis to facilitate coordinated deposition of tailored polysaccharides in the plant cell wall.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.1076298\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-01-11\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4307256177\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1101/2022.10.19.512842\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"High-resolution promoter interaction analysis in Type 3 Innate Lymphoid Cells implicates Batten Disease gene<i>CLN3</i>in Crohn\\u2019s Disease aetiology\", \"abstract\": \"Abstract Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are rare tissue-resident \\u201chelper\\u201d lymphocytes that do not express diversified antigen receptors.

To gain insight into the cis-regulatory circuitries underlying ILC3 function, we used high-resolution Capture Hi-C to profile promoter-anchored chromosomal contacts in human primary ILC3s. Combining significant interaction detection with the Activity-By-Contact approach adapted to Capture Hi-C, we reveal a multitude of contacts between promoters and distal regulatory elements and obtain evidence for distinct regulatory wiring of alternative promoters. We find that promoter-interacting regions in ILC3s are enriched for genetic variants associated with multiple immune diseases. Focusing on Crohn\\u2019s disease (CD), in which ILC3s are established mediators, we devised a Bayesian approach that incorporates multivariate fine-mapping to link CD-associated genetic variants with putative target genes. We identify known and previously unimplicated genes in conferring genetic risk of CD through activity in ILC3s. This includes the C LN3 gene that is mutated in most cases of the neurodegenerative disorder Batten disease. Using Cln3 mutant mice, we show that CLN3 is a putative negative regulator of IL-17 production in an inflammatory subset of ILC3s.

The molecular complexes that perceive and transmit the fungal pH signal are membrane-proximal and essential for virulence and are therefore of interest as novel antifungal drug targets. Intriguingly, the sensory machinery has evolved divergently in different fungal pathogens, yet spatial co-ordination of cellular components is conserved. Recent Findings The recent discovery of a novel pH sensor in the basidiomycete pathogen Cryptococcus neformans highlights that, although the molecular conservation of fungal pH sensors is evolutionarily restricted, their subcellular localisation and coupling to essential components of the cellular ESCRT machinery are consistent features of the cellular pH sensing and adaptation mechanism. In both basidiomycetes and ascomycetes, the lipid composition of the plasma membrane to which pH sensing complexes are localised appears to have pivotal functional importance. Endocytosis of pH-sensing complexes occurs in multiple fungal species, but its relevance for signal transduction appears not to be universal. Summary Our overview of current understanding highlights conserved and divergent mechanisms of the pH sensing machinery in model and pathogenic fungal species, as well as important unanswered questions that must be addressed to inform the future study of such sensing mechanisms and to devise therapeutic strategies for manipulating them.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40588-023-00195-5\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-07-28\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4280617578\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1016/j.cell.2022.05.014\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 2, \"title\": \"Potent cross-reactive antibodies following Omicron breakthrough in vaccinees\", \"abstract\": \"Highly transmissible Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 currently dominate globally.

Neutralization differences between sub-lineages for mAbs (including therapeutics) mostly arise from variation in residues bordering the ACE2 binding site; however, more distant mutations S371F (BA.2) and R346K (BA.1.1) markedly reduce neutralization by therapeutic antibody Vir-S309.

Oxygenic photosynthesis produces ROS in abundance, which act as a readout of a functional electron transport system and metabolism. The concept that photosynthetic ROS production is a major driving force in chloroplast to nucleus retrograde signalling is embedded in the literature, as is the role of chloroplasts as environmental sensors. The different complexes and components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain (PETC) regulate O 2 \\u25cf\\u2212 production in relation to light energy availability and the redox state of the stromal Cys\\u2010based redox systems. All of the ROS generated in chloroplasts have the potential to act as signals and there are many sulphhydryl\\u2010containing proteins and peptides in chloroplasts that have the potential to act as H 2 O 2 sensors and function in signal transduction. While ROS may directly move out of the chloroplasts to other cellular compartments, ROS signalling pathways can only be triggered if appropriate ROS\\u2010sensing proteins are present at or near the site of ROS production. Chloroplast antioxidant systems serve either to propagate these signals or to remove excess ROS that cannot effectively be harnessed in signalling. The key challenge is to understand how regulated ROS delivery from the PETC to the Cys\\u2010based redox machinery is organised to transmit redox signals from the environment to the nucleus.

However, ENTs lack functionally-essential features of that superfamily, suggesting that they may use a different transport mechanism. Understanding the molecular basis of their transport requires insight into diverse conformational states. Differences between intermediate states may be discrete and mediated by subtle gating interactions, such as salt bridges.

The carbamate post-translational modification is a reversible CO2-mediated adduct that can form on neutral N-terminal \\u03b1-amino or lysine \\u03b5-amino groups. Methods: We have developed triethyloxonium ion (TEO) as a chemical proteomics tool to trap the carbamate post-translational modification on protein covalently. We use 13C-NMR and TEO and identify ubiquitin as a plant CO2-binding protein. Results: We observe the carbamate post-translational modification on the Arabidopsis thaliana ubiquitin N-terminus and \\u03b5-amino groups of lysines 6, 33, and 48. We show that biologically relevant near atmospheric PCO2 levels increase ubiquitin conjugation dependent on lysine 6. We further demonstrate that CO2 increases the ubiquitin E2 ligase (AtUBC5) charging step via the transthioesterification reaction in which Ub is transferred from the E1 ligase active site to the E2 active site. Conclusions and General Significance: Therefore, plant ubiquitin is a CO2-binding protein, and the carbamate post-translational modification represents a potential mechanism through which plant cells can respond to fluctuating PCO2.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbadva.2023.100096\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-01-01\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4315853020\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1088/1361-6420/acb2ba\", \"af_direct_citation\": 1, \"af_indirect_citations\": 2, \"title\": \"Spectral decomposition of atomic structures in heterogeneous cryo-EM\", \"abstract\": \"We consider the problem of recovering the three-dimensional atomic structure of a flexible macromolecule from a heterogeneous cryo-EM dataset.

In CASP10, full molecular replacement searches were replaced by likelihood-based rigid-body refinement of models superimposed on the target using the LGA algorithm, with the metric being the refined log-likelihood-gain (LLG) score. This enabled multi-copy targets and very poor models to be evaluated, but a significant further issue remained: the requirement of diffraction data for assessment.

This reLLG is also independent of any crystal form, and can be calculated regardless of the source of the target, be it X-ray, NMR or cryo-EM. We calibrate the reLLG against the LLG for targets in CASP14, showing that it is a robust measure of both model and group ranking. Like the LLG, the reLLG shows that accurate coordinate error estimates add substantial value to predicted models.

However, the nature of Si transport in coccolithophores is not yet known, making it difficult to determine the wider role of Si in coccolithophore biology. Here, we show that coccolithophore SITLs act as Na+ -coupled Si transporters when expressed in heterologous systems and exhibit similar characteristics to diatom SITs. We find that CbSITL from Coccolithus braarudii is transcriptionally regulated by Si availability and is expressed in environmental coccolithophore populations. However, the Si requirement of C. braarudii and other coccolithophores is very low, with transport rates of exogenous Si below the level of detection in sensitive assays of Si transport. As coccoliths contain only low levels of Si, we propose that Si acts to support the calcification process, rather than forming a structural component of the coccolith itself. Si is therefore acting as a micronutrient in coccolithophores and natural populations are only likely to experience Si limitation in circumstances where dissolved silicon (DSi) is depleted to extreme levels.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.16280\", \"publication_date\": \"2022-11-22\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4312526408\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1093/bioadv/vbac087\", \"af_direct_citation\": 1, \"af_indirect_citations\": 5, \"title\": \"OAF: a new member of the BRICHOS family\", \"abstract\": \"The 10 known BRICHOS domain-containing proteins in humans have been linked to an unusually long list of pathologies, including cancer, obesity and two amyloid-like diseases.

We employed protein modelling and prediction tools to identify the catalytic determinants that these E2s use to interact with ubiquitin as well as their substrates. Our results join a stream of recent literature that challenges the definition of ubiquitylation as an exquisitely lysine-specific modification and provide crucial insights into the missing E2 element responsible for non-canonical ubiquitylation. Teaser E2 conjugating enzymes (E2s) play a fundamental role in the attachment of ubiquitin to its substrate. Most E2s can form an isopeptide bond between the ubiquitin C- terminus and a lysine present on the substrate. We identified a family of E2s, UBE2Q1 and UBE2Q2, able to target amino acids other than lysine. Currently nothing is known about their mechanism of action and what substrates they are targeting, even though genetic ablation of UBE2Q1 produce substantial infertility in mice. Here we answer the question about what the key residues beneath their peculiar activity are. We discovered that UBE2Q1 target the lysine-free cytoplasmic domain of the Golgi resident protein Beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1, providing an interesting precedent for the role of non-canonical ubiquitylation in eukaryotic cells.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.05.531151\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-03-05\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4308365540\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1093/femsre/fuac044\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"<i>In situ, in vivo</i>, and <i>in vitro</i> approaches for studying AMR plasmid conjugation in the gut microbiome\", \"abstract\": \"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat, with evolution and spread of resistance to frontline antibiotics outpacing the development of novel treatments.

SAP05 forms a ternary complex via interactions with the von Willebrand Factor Type A (vWA) domain of the proteasomal ubiquitin receptor Rpn10 and the Zinc-finger (ZnF) domains of the SQUAMOSA-PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) and GATA BINDING FACTOR (GATA) transcription factors (TFs).

For efficient bacterial growth to occur, and to increase productivity and titres, a high resistance to the gas is required. The aerobic bacterium Cupriavidus necator H16 can grow on CO2 + H2, although it cannot utilise CO as a source of carbon and energy. This study aimed to increase its CO resistance through adaptive laboratory evolution. Results: To increase the tolerance of C. necator to CO, the organism was continually subcultured in the presence of CO both heterotrophically and autotrophically. Ten individual cultures were evolved heterotrophically with fructose in this manner and eventually displayed a clear growth advantage over the wild type strain. Next-generation sequencing revealed several mutations, including a single point mutation upstream of a cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase operon (cydA2B2), which was present in all evolved isolates. When a subset of these mutations was engineered into the parental H16 strain, only the cydA2B2 upstream mutation enabled faster growth in the presence of CO. Expression analysis, mutation, overexpression and complementation suggested that cydA2B2 transcription is upregulated in the evolved isolates, resulting in increased CO tolerance under heterotrophic but not autotrophic conditions. However, through subculturing on a syngas-like mixture with increasing CO concentrations, C. necator could also be evolved to tolerate high CO concentrations under autotrophic conditions. A mutation in the gene for the soluble [NiFe]-hydrogenase subunit hoxH was identified in the evolved isolates. When the resulting amino acid change was engineered into the parental strain, autotrophic CO resistance was conferred. A strain constitutively expressing cydA2B2 and the mutated hoxH gene exhibited high CO tolerance under both heterotrophic and autotrophic conditions. Conclusion:C. necator was evolved to tolerate high concentrations of CO, a phenomenon which was dependent on the terminal respiratory cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase when grown heterotrophically and the soluble [NiFe]-hydrogenase when grown autotrophically. A strain exhibiting high tolerance under both conditions was created and presents a promising chassis for syngas-based bioproduction processes.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2023.1178536\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-04-24\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4311948686\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1101/2022.12.15.519894\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 8, \"title\": \"Codon language embeddings provide strong signals for protein engineering\", \"abstract\": \"Abstract Protein representations from deep language models have yielded state-of-the-art performance across many tasks in computational protein engineering.

Using this simple screen, we identify Rgs1, a regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) protein that is necessary for appressorium development, as a novel transcriptional regulator of effector gene expression, which acts prior to plant infection. We show that an N-terminal domain of Rgs1, possessing transactivation activity, is required for effector gene regulation and acts in an RGS-independent manner. Rgs1 controls the expression of at least 60 temporally coregulated effector genes, preventing their transcription during the prepenetration stage of development prior to plant infection. A regulator of appressorium morphogenesis is therefore also required for the orchestration of pathogen gene expression required for invasive growth by M. oryzae during plant infection.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2301358120\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-03-13\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4367676465\", \"doi_x\": \"10.12688/wellcomeopenres.18937.2\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 2, \"title\": \"Structure of the transmembrane protein 2 (TMEM2) ectodomain and its apparent lack of hyaluronidase activity\", \"abstract\": \"<ns4:p><ns4:bold>Background: </ns4:bold>Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a major polysaccharide component of the extracellular matrix.

The late insertion pathway exploits a CoII metallochaperone (CobW) from the COG0523 family of G3E GTPases, while the early insertion pathway does not. This provides an opportunity to contrast the thermodynamics of metalation in a metallochaperone-requiring and a metallochaperone-independent pathway. In the metallochaperone-independent route, sirohydrochlorin (SHC) associates with the CbiK chelatase to form CoII-SHC. CoII-buffered enzymatic assays indicate that SHC binding enhances the thermodynamic gradient for CoII transfer from the cytosol to CbiK. In the metallochaperone-dependent pathway, hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide (HBAD) associates with the CobNST chelatase to form CoII-HBAD. Here, CoII-buffered enzymatic assays indicate that CoII transfer from the cytosol to HBAD-CobNST must somehow traverse a highly unfavorable thermodynamic gradient for CoII binding. Notably, there is a favorable gradient for CoII transfer from the cytosol to the MgIIGTP-CobW metallochaperone, but further transfer of CoII from the GTP-bound metallochaperone to the HBAD-CobNST chelatase complex is thermodynamically unfavorable. However, after nucleotide hydrolysis, CoII transfer from the chaperone to the chelatase complex is calculated to become favorable. These data reveal that the CobW metallochaperone can overcome an unfavorable thermodynamic gradient for CoII transfer from the cytosol to the chelatase by coupling this process to GTP hydrolysis.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1021/jacsau.3c00119\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-05-10\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4306407174\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1038/s41467-022-33792-x\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"SARS-COV-2 antibody responses to AZD1222 vaccination in West Africa\", \"abstract\": \"Real-world data on vaccine-elicited neutralising antibody responses for two-dose AZD1222 in African populations are limited.

Unexpectedly, our initial attempts to generate a bioluminescent reporter of strain NIH4215 for in vivo drug efficacy studies failed, as NIH4215 was unable to grow on defined minimal medium. Subsequent analyses discovered a previously undescribed thiamine auxotrophy of strain NIH4215 and transformation with thiamine biosynthesis genes from A. fumigatus strain Af293 identified the nmt1 gene as cause of the thiamine auxotrophy. Sequencing of the defective nmt1 gene revealed the loss of a cysteine codon within an essential iron-binding motif. Subsequently, the wild-type nmt1 gene was successfully used to generate a bioluminescent reporter strain in NIH4215 by simultaneously deleting the akuB locus. The resulting bioluminescent \\u0394 akuB strains showed a high frequency of homologous integration as confirmed by generation of pyrG and niaD deletion mutants. When tested in a Galleria mellonella infection model, neither thiamine auxotrophy nor the deletion of the akuB locus had a significant effect on virulence.

A proposed increased mutation rate of NIH4215 was confirmed by screening for spontaneous occurrence of fluoorotic acid resistant mutants. Independent mutations in the pyrG and pyrE gene were identified in the fluoroorotic acid resistant NIH4215 isolates and the frequency of mutation was by at least one order of magnitude higher than that observed for the clinical A. fumigatus isolate CBS144.89.

Our results show that several members of the TAL protein family are important in host protection to both these major schistosome species. For the first time we demonstrate that a progressive cross-reactive TAL-IgE response occurs against S. haematobium , similar to that previous observed in S. mansoni infection.

The release of the AlphaFold 2.0 software enables the prediction of highly accurate protein structures and opens many opportunities to advance our understanding of protein functions, including the detection of homologous protein structure pairs. Results In this proof-of-concept work, we search for the closest homologous protein pairs using the structure models of five model organisms from the AlphaFold database. We compare the results with homologous protein pairs detected by their sequence similarity and show that the structural matching approach finds a similar set of results. In addition, we detect potential novel homologs solely with the structural matching approach, which can help to understand the function of uncharacterized proteins and make previously overlooked connections between well-characterized proteins. We also observe limitations of our implementation of the structure-based approach, particularly when handling highly disordered proteins or short protein structures.

For example, MS techniques can report on protein structural dynamics, stoichiometry, connectivity, solvent accessibility, and binding interactions with ligands, lipids, and other proteins. This information proving powerful when used in conjunction with complementary structural biology methods and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In the present review, aimed at those not experts in MS techniques, we report on the current uses of MS in studying multidrug efflux systems, practical considerations to consider, and the future direction of the field.

The corresponding control sequences do not exhibit such structural polymorphism, as diagnosed via end-to-end distance and a dihedral angle defined for the monomer. A similar heat capacity analysis for dimer conformations obtained using basin-hopping global optimisation shows clear features in end-to-end distance versus dihedral correlation plots, where amyloid-forming sequences exhibit a preference for larger end-to-end distances and larger positive dihedrals. These results hold true for sequences taken from tau, amylin, insulin A chain, a de novo designed peptide, and various control sequences.

In 2022, the first gapless human genome assembly was published [1.Nurk S. et al.The complete sequence of a human genome.Science. 2022; 376: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar], a little more than 20 years after the landmark completion of the draft assembly was announced [2.International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium Finishing the euchromatic sequence of the human genome.Nature. 2004; 431: 931-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar]. This publicly available resource \\u2013 the result of multinational collaborative efforts \\u2013 is arguably one of our most important scientific achievements. The impact of this project extends far beyond the genome sequence itself; technological and analytical advancement made during and after the Human Genome Project has driven the ever-increasing accessibility of \\u2018genomics\\u2019 \\u2013 the study of the structure, composition, function, and evolution of genomes \\u2013 to other, nonhuman species. Such advances now allow genome-sequencing projects to be undertaken all over the world on potentially any organism with accessible DNA, from routine experiments found in any modest molecular biology laboratory to sequencing in extreme environments [3.Castro-Wallace S.L. et al.Nanopore DNA sequencing and genome assembly on the International Space Station.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 18022Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar] or in response to disease [4.Volz E. et al.Assessing transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 in England.Nature. 2021; 593: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar], to cataloguing the genomes of all life on Earth [5.Lewin H.A. et al.Earth BioGenome Project: Sequencing life for the future of life.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: 4325-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar]. The study of parasitic worms, collectively termed helminths, has benefited significantly from this genomic revolution. Often considered \\u2018neglected\\u2019 parasites, helminths affect over a billion people living in some of the lowest-resource countries worldwide and significantly impact global livestock and agriculture industries. Despite this neglect, several sustained efforts have been made to generate genomic resources for helminths, with broad aims including the understanding of parasite biology and life-history traits [6.International Helminth Genomes Consortium Comparative genomics of the major parasitic worms.Nat. Genet. 2019; 51: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar], mining new drug targets [7.Cotton J.A. et al.The genome of Onchocerca volvulus, agent of river blindness.Nat. Microbiol. 2016; 2: 16216Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar], and characterising genetic traits such as drug resistance [8.Doyle S.R. Cotton J.A. Genome-wide approaches to investigate anthelmintic resistance.Trends Parasitol. 2019; 35: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar]. The principal repository for these data, WormBase ParaSite [9.Howe K.L. et al.WormBase ParaSite \\u2212 a comprehensive resource for helminth genomics.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2017; 215: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar], now contains 210 genomes and annotations (see Glossary) from 169 species of nematodes and flatworms (WormBase ParaSite release 17), representing some of the most pathogenic helminth species of humans, animals, and plants as well as closely related species for comparison. These genome resources are the starting point of many molecular and computational experiments and form the scaffold upon which many \\u2018omic experiments and analyses rely. Although intentionally provocative and somewhat oversimplified, there is some truth to this statement; a genome assembly and its annotation are a hypothesis of the structure and content of the genomic DNA within an organism from which they are derived but, despite best efforts, rarely resemble the complete product. For example, biologically, a genome is defined as all of the DNA within a cell and is found assembled into discrete chromosomes but, more often than not, genomes are represented informatically by contigs and scaffolds that number in the thousands or more and vary significantly in their \\u2018completeness\\u2019 (see Figure 1 for a comparison of helminth genome assemblies and BUSCO [10.Manni M. et al.BUSCO Update: novel and streamlined workflows along with broader and deeper phylogenetic coverage for scoring of eukaryotic, prokaryotic, and viral genomes.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2021; 38: 4647-4654Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar] completeness available from WormBase ParaSite release 17; 80.9% of genome assemblies are in 1000 or more contigs/scaffolds). Despite recent technological and analytical advancements that make it cheaper, easier, and more likely to produce highly contiguous and even chromosome-scale assemblies, it is still challenging to generate finished genomes for eukaryotic species such as helminths. A key challenge is that there is not one molecular/sequencing/analytical approach optimised for all organisms. Although helminth genomes are not considered to be large or particularly complex for a eukaryotic organism (the median genome assembly size is 122.18 Mb, and range from 38.18 Mb for Meloidogyne graminicola to 1.25 Gb for Spirometra erinaceieuropaei), helminth-focused genome projects are further challenged by a range of factors. These challenges include: (i) vast differences in morphology and tissue composition, both within species (i.e., between life stages) and between species, may require different approaches to DNA extraction and lead to differences in extraction efficiencies [11.Ayana M. et al.Comparison of four DNA extraction and three preservation protocols for the molecular detection and quantification of soil-transmitted helminths in stool.PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2019; 13e0007778Google Scholar,12.Doyle S.R. et al.Evaluation of DNA extraction methods on individual helminth egg and larval stages for whole-genome sequencing.Front. Genet. 2019; 10: 826Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar]; (ii) the inaccessibility of parasite DNA, for example, larger mature life stages with more DNA are also likely to be in vivo parasitic stages, whereas for some species, accessible juvenile stages such as eggs and larvae are typically microscopic and may be environmentally resistant, further limiting DNA extraction yield [12]; (iii) further inaccessibility to DNA based on parasite host and geographic location, for example, despite infecting over a billion people worldwide, mature stages of human-infective helminths can be incredibly difficult to access particularly in low-resource settings where they are most commonly found [13.Doyle S.R. et al.Population genomics of ancient and modern Trichuris trichiura.bioRxiv. 2021; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.21.464505Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar], and even if available, it can be difficult to preserve high-quality samples (tissue or DNA) if access to a laboratory or cold-chain is limited; and (iv) the high degree of genetic heterogeneity among individuals of many helminth species which, if pooling of samples is required to generate sufficient DNA for sequencing, can lead to assembly artefacts [14.Doyle S.R. et al.Genomic and transcriptomic variation defines the chromosome-scale assembly of Haemonchus contortus, a model gastrointestinal worm.Commun. Biol. 2020; 3: 656Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar]. Some of these challenges can be addressed and potentially overcome by specific technological developments that now allow very low-input DNA concentrations for sequencing [15.Kingan S.B. et al.a high-quality de novo genome assembly from a single mosquito using pacbio sequencing.Genes. 2019; 10: 62Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar], particularly if an individual helminth specimen can be sequenced. Nonetheless, one or more of these issues will have undoubtedly limited the ability of each of the existing helminth genome assembly projects to achieve a contiguous reference genome. The genome assembly is only one part of the puzzle. Once an assembly is \\u2018finished\\u2019, efforts are then made to determine the coordinates of coding, noncoding and other feature content of the genome, which is often followed by an attempt to identify and characterise the function of these annotations. Several computational pipelines have been developed for annotating helminth genomes (for example, see [6.International Helminth Genomes Consortium Comparative genomics of the major parasitic worms.Nat. Genet. 2019; 51: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar] for a description of the 50 Helminths Genome Consortium pipeline, applied at scale). In contrast, other approaches use one or a combination of annotation tools (for example, Augustus [16.Hoff K.J. Stanke M. Predicting genes in single genomes with AUGUSTUS.Curr. Protoc. Bioinform. 2019; 65e57PubMed Google Scholar], Braker [17.Br\\u016fna T. et al.BRAKER2: automatic eukaryotic genome annotation with GeneMark-EP+ and AUGUSTUS supported by a protein database.NAR Genom. Bioinform. 2021; 3lqaa108PubMed Google Scholar], Maker [18.Holt C. Yandell M. MAKER2: an annotation pipeline and genome-database management tool for second-generation genome projects.BMC Bioinform. 2011; 12: 491Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar], PASA [19.Haas B.J. et al.Improving the Arabidopsis genome annotation using maximal transcript alignment assemblies.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5654-5666Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar]) which can use and combine various additional datasets, for example, RNA-seq data or homologous protein sequences from a closely related species, as evidence to identify putative features within the genome. The quality of these predictions is highly dependent on the quality of the assembly, the type and amount of evidence used, and how representative that evidence is of the features in the genome. For example, mapped RNA-seq data are broadly considered to be good evidence to identify intron\\u2013exon splice junctions of gene models; however, there is a bias towards genes that are more highly expressed, whereas lowly expressed genes or genes not expressed in the life stage/condition that the RNA-seq data were derived from will not be predicted as reliably. While many of the computational prediction pipelines will perform well, given sufficient evidence, even under an ideal scenario there will still be errors in the annotation [20.Salzberg S.L. Next-generation genome annotation: we still struggle to get it right.Genome Biol. 2019; 20: 92Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar]. Many of these errors will not be evident until an annotation is manually inspected, gene-by-gene, using available evidence in a genome browser; given that the median coding gene content of helminth genomes is 16 380 features (ranging from 8140 coding genes for Onchocerca flexuosa to 101 269 for Meloidogyne arenaria), this is not a trivial task. Unfortunately, most genome annotations available will not have been generated under an ideal scenario, and even fewer will be thoroughly interrogated manually. Examples of genome annotation errors include gene models that may be fragmented or multiple genes incorrectly merged, genes broken by technical errors such as fragmented assemblies or sequencing errors that produce stop codons or frameshifts, or missing genes due to a lack of evidence or divergence from the training dataset. Such errors complicate analyses of orthology typically used to define evolutionary and putative functional relationships of genes within and between species, and likely confounds estimates of shared and species-specific annotations [21.Weisman C.M. et al.Mixing genome annotation methods in a comparative analysis inflates the apparent number of lineage-specific genes.Curr. Biol. 2022; 32: 1-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar]. Many examples in the literature describe the cloning and validation of a gene structure in response to identifying an error in a gene model from a genomic resource; unfortunately, these updated experimentally validated models are rarely used to correct the original resource. Further challenges are associated with the functional characterisation of gene models of non-model organisms such as helminths. It has recently been estimated that over 47% of gene families lack any functional annotation [6.International Helminth Genomes Consortium Comparative genomics of the major parasitic worms.Nat. Genet. 2019; 51: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar], rendering many as \\u2018hypothetical\\u2019 [22.International Molecular Helminthology Annotation Network (IMHAN) et al.Tackling hypotheticals in helminth genomes.Trends Parasitol. 2018; 34: 179-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar], and those that do have functional information will have relied heavily on computation inference based on homology with a closely related species. Such information, or lack thereof, can make interpreting genomic data difficult; analyses that point to a specific region of interest within the genome may reveal a list of genes with no known function, whereas approaches such as gene set enrichment will be biased towards genes with known functions and common gene ontologies. Because incorrect annotations are not immediately obvious, particularly at scale, research will repeatedly be based on the original genome resource and, consequently, not benefit from new information identified. Furthermore, even if the limitations are known, the effort required to update these data by an individual is large and, therefore, impractical, especially for genome-wide analyses that rely on the whole genome and annotation. More genomics data are not necessarily the solution, and the direct study of gene function \\u2013 particularly of genes with novel, parasite-specific roles \\u2013 is still needed [23.Viney M. The failure of genomics in biology.Trends Parasitol. 2014; 30: 319-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar]. Such analyses of gene function, including deciphering the functional role of hypothetical proteins, may be supported or even enhanced by novel computational approaches such as 3D structure predictions by AlphaFold [24.Jumper J. et al.Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold.Nature. 2021; 596: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (4221) Google Scholar]. However, without improvements in the coordination and feedback of information between the functional validation of genes and the genomes from which they are based, progress towards a better understanding of helminth functional biology will ultimately be limited. Now, in the \\u2018post-genomic\\u2019 era, the rate and scale of new data generated for helminths are steadily growing [25.McVeigh P. Post-genomic progress in helminth parasitology.Parasitology. 2020; 147: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar]. Genome-led analyses now include, for example, characterising transcription at single-cell [26.Diaz Soria C.L. et al.Single-cell atlas of the first intra-mammalian developmental stage of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni.Nat.

Cell. Infect. Microbiol. 2021; 11653695Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar], and targeted genome modification and transgenesis are becoming more efficient in a range of species [34.Gang S.S. et al.Targeted mutagenesis in a human-parasitic nematode.PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13e1006675Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 35.Ittiprasert W. et al.Programmed genome editing of the omega-1 ribonuclease of the blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni.eLife. 2019; 8e41337Crossref Google Scholar, 36.Arunsan P. et al.Programmed knockout mutation of liver fluke granulin attenuates virulence of infection-induced hepatobiliary morbidity.eLife. 2019; 8e41463Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 37.Sankaranarayanan G. et al.Large CRISPR-Cas-induced deletions in the oxamniquine resistance locus of the human parasite.Wellcome Open Res. 2020; 5: 178Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar]. These genomic analyses are also increasingly being complemented by other \\u2018omic approaches such as proteomics [38.Wang T. et al.Somatic proteome of Haemonchus contortus.Int. J. Parasitol. 2019; 49: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar], peptidomics [39.Buzy A. et al.Peptidomics of Haemonchus contortus.ACS Omega. 2021; 6: 10288-10305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar], metabolomics [40.Kokova D.

Twenty years on: metabolomics in helminth research.Trends Parasitol. 2019; 35: 282-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar], and lipidomics [41.Wang T. et al.Helminth lipidomics: technical aspects and future prospects.Curr. Res. Parasitol. Vector Borne Dis. 2021; 1100018Google Scholar]. However, generating \\u2018omics data that heavily rely on existing genomics resources is potentially problematic. The first problem is that many approaches are based on the assumption that the reference genome and annotation are essentially \\u2018correct\\u2019 (see the previous subheading); if one or both are incomplete or erroneous, then biological insights will surely be missed or, worse, misinterpreted. The second problem is that these information-rich datasets have significant potential to add value to the reference genome and annotation but rarely, if ever, are used to do so. A genome and annotation are largely static resources that, once published, do not change; new information generated \\u2013 whether primary data or a synthesis of literature \\u2013 remain distinct and are not typically used to improve or enrich the genome resource upon which they are based. Addressing these two points has been the focus of research efforts for a limited number of helminth species, which have seen iterative improvement in the genomic resources over time from fragmented draft assemblies to chromosome-scale and reference-quality assemblies (Figure 2). These improvements have led to fundamental new insights into parasite biology that could not have been addressed using a draft genome, including the resolution of drug resistance QTL in Haemonchus contortus [42.Doyle S.R. et al.Population genomic and evolutionary modelling analyses reveal a single major QTL for ivermectin drug resistance in the pathogenic nematode, Haemonchus contortus.BMC Genom. 2019; 20: 218Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar,43.Doyle S.R. et al.Genomic landscape of drug response reveals novel mediators of anthelmintic resistance.bioRxiv. 2022; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.12.465712Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar], the evolution of sex chromosomes of Brugia malayi (and related filarial species) [44.Foster J.M. et al.Sex chromosome evolution in parasitic nematodes of humans.Nat.

These examples demonstrate that improvements to existing resources can be achieved with measurable effects and novel insights made. Therefore, the question remains: how could (or should) this be done more broadly, and by whom? (Box 1 outlines the access, synthesis, and extension of genomic resources for helminths). The examples of genome improvement, from draft to a complete representation of the genome and associated data (as described above and in Figure 2), have been achieved by discrete research groups working over many years and often motivated by a specific research question. For a limited number of helminth genomes \\u2013 currently, B. malayi, Onchocerca volvulus, Strongyloides ratti, and Trichuris muris \\u2013 dedicated manual curation of their annotations are ongoing as part of the WormBase core genome group (which also includes Caenorhabditis elegans, and other Caenorhabditis spp., and Pristionchus pacificus), or from individual curation efforts (Box 2 describes the manual curation of the H. contortus genome annotation). For the remaining 95% of genomes in WormBase ParaSite, the scope for improvement seems less certain, especially given that relying on dedicated curators is unlikely to scale for the large number and diversity of species for which curation is required. However, the communities that use these resources are far greater in size and cumulative expertise; although communities contribute knowledge via the publication of research based on the genome resource, this knowledge remains separate from the genome resource itself. This is a missed opportunity that needs to be taken advantage of. What is currently lacking are the mechanisms by which new data and knowledge can easily be transferred and integrated into dynamic resources that can change and improve over time. Such a mechanism should function at both small and large scales, whether curating the structure of a single-gene model or describing the function of a whole gene family or more. Although such a mechanism, when considered as a final product, may seem complex and therefore unachievable, there are already easy-to-use tools available for collaborative curation (e.g., Web Apollo [47.Dunn N.A. et al.Apollo: democratizing genome annotation.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2019; 15e1006790Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar]) and initiatives underway that exploit the use of both experts and non-experts alike in the shared goal of improving genome resources for specific nematode species (see Box 2 for examples of initiatives to improve the Trichuris trichiura and P. pacificus annotations). More broadly, WormBase ParaSite is an existing platform and centralised repository of helminth genomic data and can both integrate new and synthesise available data, providing that new and improved genomes and annotations are made publicly available and open access without restriction.Box 1Access, synthesis and extension of genomic resources for helminths1.Depositing genetic and genomic data in open-access repositories\\u2022NCBIi: DNA/protein sequences, largely focussed on genes, proteins, and genomes.\\u2022ENAii & SRAiii: raw high-throughput sequencing reads, genomes, annotations.\\u2022WormBase ParaSiteiv: the major repository of genomes and annotations of parasitic and related free-living nematodes and platyhelminths.2.Synthesis of available resources\\u2022WormBase ParaSiteivoAlthough WormBase ParaSite is primarily a repository for genomes and annotations, inferred protein sequences from the genomes and annotations are transferred to UniProtv, the major repository of protein sequence and functional information for all specieso(Re-)integrates genome annotations at each release and as new genomes/annotations become available.

These are unified into a single superfamily through their bridges being composed of just one domain, called the repeating beta groove (RBG) domain, which builds into rod shaped multimers with a hydrophobic-lined groove and hydrophilic exterior.

Therefore, this study addressed the compositional patterns of two coral snake venoms from Ecuador, M. helleri and M. mipartitus, using venomics strategies, integrating sample fractionation, gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry. Chromatographic and electrophoretic profiles of these snake venoms revealed interspecific variability, which was ascertained by mass spectrometry. The two venoms followed the recently recognised dichotomic toxin expression trends displayed by Micrurus species: M. helleri venom contains a high proportion (72%) of phospholipase A2, whereas M. mipartitus venom is dominated by three-finger toxins (63%). A few additional protein families were also detected in these venoms. Overall, these results provide the first comprehensive views on the composition of two Ecuadorian coral snake venoms and expand the knowledge of Micrurus venom phenotypes.

The prediction analyses of the MHC class II binding peptides within the S protein have shown that the RGD motif is present in the core 9-mer peptide IRGDEVRQI within the two HLA-DRB1*03:01 and HLA-DRB3*01.01 strong binding 15-mer peptides suggesting that RGD motif may be the potential immune epitope. Accordingly, infected HLA-DRB1*03:01 or HLA-DRB3*01.01 positive individuals may develop high affinity anti-RGD motif antibodies that react with the RGD motif in the host proteins, like fibrinogen, thrombin or von Willebrand factor, affecting haemostasis or participating in autoimmune disorders.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1177691\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-07-10\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4379469725\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1016/j.cub.2023.03.037\", \"af_direct_citation\": 1, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"Contrasting self-recognition rejection systems for self-incompatibility in Brassica and Papaver\", \"abstract\": \"Self-incompatibility (SI) plays a pivotal role in whether self-pollen is accepted or rejected.

The cell surface abundance of the adhesion molecule Neurofascin, a protein critical for the maintenance of myelin-axon contacts, changes following disruption to sphingolipid metabolism.

We identify MARCHF6, through its NADPH-mediated activation in hypoxia, as the main ubiquitin ligase controlling SREBP2 stability.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The angiotensin AT2 receptor (AT2R) is now regarded as a fully functional and important component of the renin-angiotensin system, with the potential of exerting protective actions in a variety of diseases. This review provides an in-depth view of the AT2R, which has progressed from being an enigma to becoming a therapeutic target.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1124/pharmrev.120.000281\", \"publication_date\": \"2022-09-30\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4379467311\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1073/pnas.2302580120\", \"af_direct_citation\": 1, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"Activator-induced conformational changes regulate division-associated peptidoglycan amidases\", \"abstract\": \"AmiA and AmiB are peptidoglycan-hydrolyzing enzymes from Escherichia coli that are required to break the peptidoglycan layer during bacterial cell division and maintain integrity of the cell envelope.

Activation of AmiA and AmiB requires access to a groove in the amidase-activating LytM domain of EnvC which is gated by ATP-driven conformational changes in FtsEX-EnvC complex. Here, we present a high-resolution structure of the isolated AmiA protein, confirming that it is autoinhibited in the same manner as AmiB and AmiC, and a complex of the AmiB enzymatic domain bound to the activating EnvC LytM domain. In isolation, the active site of AmiA is blocked by an autoinhibitory helix that binds directly to the catalytic zinc and fills the volume expected to accommodate peptidoglycan binding. In the complex, binding of the EnvC LytM domain induces a conformational change that displaces the amidase autoinhibitory helix and reorganizes the active site for activity.

Sequence and bioinformatic analysis predicts that PtTamH comprises an N-terminal, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent transaminase (TA) domain fused to a NADH-dependent C-terminal thioester reductase (TR) domain. Spectroscopic and chemical analysis revealed that the TA domain binds PLP, utilizes l-Glu as an amine donor, accepts a range of fatty aldehydes (C7-C14 with a preference for C12), and produces the corresponding amines. The previously characterized PtTamA from the \\\"tam\\\" BGC is an ATP-dependent, di-domain enzyme comprising a class I adenylation domain fused to an acyl carrier protein (ACP). Since recombinant PtTamA catalyzes the activation and thioesterification of C12 acid to the holo-ACP domain, we hypothesized that C12 ACP is the natural substrate for PtTamH. PtTamA and PtTamH were successfully coupled together in a biocatalytic cascade that converts fatty acids (FAs) to amines in one pot. Moreover, a structural model of PtTamH provides insights into how the TA and TR domains are organized.

These defence systems require a sensor domain to bind the cyclic nucleotide and are often coupled with an effector domain that, when activated, causes cell death by destroying essential biomolecules3. One example is the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, which degrades the essential cofactor NAD+ when activated in response to infection in plants and bacteria2,4,5 or during programmed nerve cell death6. Here we show that a bacterial antiviral defence system generates a cyclic tri-adenylate that binds to a TIR-SAVED effector, acting as the 'glue' to allow assembly of an extended superhelical solenoid structure. Adjacent TIR subunits interact to organize and complete a composite active site, allowing NAD+ degradation. Activation requires extended filament formation, both in vitro and in vivo.

Recent discovery of the antioxidant function of CoA has highlighted its protective role that leads to the formation of a mixed disulfide bond with protein cysteines, which is termed protein CoAlation. To date, more than 2000 CoAlated bacterial and mammalian proteins have been identified in cellular responses to oxidative stress, with the majority being involved in metabolic pathways (60%). Studies have shown that protein CoAlation is a widespread post-translational modification which modulates the activity and conformation of the modified proteins. The induction of protein CoAlation by oxidative stress was found to be rapidly reversed after the removal of oxidizing agents from the medium of cultured cells. In this study, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based deCoAlation assay to detect deCoAlation activity from Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus megaterium lysates. We then used a combination of ELISA-based assay and purification strategies to show that deCoAlation is an enzyme-driven mechanism. Using mass-spectrometry and deCoAlation assays, we identified B. subtilis YtpP (thioredoxin-like protein) and thioredoxin A (TrxA) as enzymes that can remove CoA from different substrates. With mutagenesis studies, we identified YtpP and TrxA catalytic cysteine residues and proposed a possible deCoAlation mechanism for CoAlated methionine sulfoxide reducatse A (MsrA) and peroxiredoxin 5 (PRDX5) proteins, which results in the release of both CoA and the reduced form of MsrA or PRDX5.

Here, we present a conceptual framework, its translation into the computational workflow AGNOSTOS and a demonstration on how we can bridge the known-unknown gap in genomes and metagenomes. By analyzing 415,971,742 genes predicted from 1749 metagenomes and 28,941 bacterial and archaeal genomes, we quantify the extent of the unknown fraction, its diversity, and its relevance across multiple organisms and environments. The unknown sequence space is exceptionally diverse, phylogenetically more conserved than the known fraction and predominantly taxonomically restricted at the species level. From the 71 M genes identified to be of unknown function, we compiled a collection of 283,874 lineage-specific genes of unknown function for Cand.

Finally, by identifying a target gene of unknown function for antibiotic resistance, we demonstrate how we can enable the generation of hypotheses that can be used to augment experimental data.It is estimated that scientists do not know what half of microbial genes actually do. When these genes are discovered in microorganisms grown in the lab or found in environmental samples, it is not possible to identify what their roles are. Many of these genes are excluded from further analyses for these reasons, meaning that the study of microbial genes tends to be limited to genes that have already been described. These limitations hinder research into microbiology, because information from newly discovered genes cannot be integrated to better understand how these organisms work. Experiments to understand what role these genes have in the microorganisms are labor-intensive, so new analytical strategies are needed. To do this, Vanni et al. developed a new framework to categorize genes with unknown roles, and a computational workflow to integrate them into traditional analyses. When this approach was applied to over 400 million microbial genes (both with known and unknown roles), it showed that the share of genes with unknown functions is only about 30 per cent, smaller than previously thought. The analysis also showed that these genes are very diverse, revealing a huge space for future research and potential applications. Combining their approach with experimental data, Vanni et al. were able to identify a gene with a previously unknown purpose that could be involved in antibiotic resistance.

The success of screening campaigns relies on the fraction of sequence space that can be sampled, whether for evolving a particular enzyme or screening metagenomes. Ultrahigh-throughput screening (uHTS) based on in vitro compartmentalization in water-in-oil emulsion of picoliter droplets generated in microfluidic systems allows screening rates >1 kHz (or >107 per day). Screening for carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) catalyzing biotechnologically valuable reactions in this format presents an additional challenge because the released carbohydrates are difficult to monitor in high throughput. Activated substrates with large optically active hydrophobic leaving groups provide a generic optical readout, but the molecular recognition properties of sugars will be altered by the incorporation of such fluoro- or chromophores and their typically higher reactivity, as leaving groups with lowered pKa values compared to native substrates make the observation of promiscuous reactions more likely. To overcome these issues, we designed microdroplet assays in which optically inactive carbohydrate products are made visible by specific cascades: the primary reaction of an unlabeled substrate leads to an optical signal downstream. Successfully implementing such assays at the picoliter droplet scale allowed us to detect glucose, xylose, glucuronic acid, and arabinose as final products of complex oligosaccharide degradation by glycoside hydrolases by absorbance measurements.

This study sought to determine whether intranasal dosing of nafamostat at 5 mg/kg twice daily was able to prevent the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected to uninfected Syrian Golden hamsters. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detectable in the throat swabs of the water-treated control group 4 days after cohabitation with a SARS-CoV-2 inoculated hamster. However, throat swabs from the intranasal nafamostat-treated hamsters remained SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative for the full 4 days of cohabitation. Significantly lower SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations were seen in the nasal turbinates of the nafamostat-treated group compared to the control (p = 0.001). A plaque assay quantified a significantly lower concentration of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs of the nafamostat-treated group compared to the control (p = 0.035).

We aimed to better characterise omicron severity relative to delta by assessing the relative risk of hospital attendance, hospital admission, or death in a large national cohort.MethodsIndividual-level data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases resident in England between Nov 29, 2021, and Jan 9, 2022, were linked to routine datasets on vaccination status, hospital attendance and admission, and mortality. The relative risk of hospital attendance or admission within 14 days, or death within 28 days after confirmed infection, was estimated using proportional hazards regression. Analyses were stratified by test date, 10-year age band, ethnicity, residential region, and vaccination status, and were further adjusted for sex, index of multiple deprivation decile, evidence of a previous infection, and year of age within each age band. A secondary analysis estimated variant-specific and vaccine-specific vaccine effectiveness and the intrinsic relative severity of omicron infection compared with delta (ie, the relative risk in unvaccinated cases).FindingsThe adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of hospital attendance (not necessarily resulting in admission) with omicron compared with delta was 0\\u00b756 (95% CI 0\\u00b754\\u20130\\u00b758); for hospital admission and death, HR estimates were 0\\u00b741 (0\\u00b739\\u20130\\u00b743) and 0\\u00b731 (0\\u00b726\\u20130\\u00b737), respectively. Omicron versus delta HR estimates varied with age for all endpoints examined. The adjusted HR for hospital admission was 1\\u00b710 (0\\u00b785\\u20131\\u00b742) in those younger than 10 years, decreasing to 0\\u00b725 (0\\u00b721\\u20130\\u00b730) in 60\\u201369-year-olds, and then increasing to 0\\u00b747 (0\\u00b740\\u20130\\u00b756) in those aged at least 80 years. For both variants, past infection gave some protection against death both in vaccinated (HR 0\\u00b747 [0\\u00b732\\u20130\\u00b768]) and unvaccinated (0\\u00b718 [0\\u00b706\\u20130\\u00b757]) cases. In vaccinated cases, past infection offered no additional protection against hospital admission beyond that provided by vaccination (HR 0\\u00b796 [0\\u00b788\\u20131\\u00b704]); however, for unvaccinated cases, past infection gave moderate protection (HR 0\\u00b755 [0\\u00b748\\u20130\\u00b763]). Omicron versus delta HR estimates were lower for hospital admission (0\\u00b730 [0\\u00b728\\u20130\\u00b732]) in unvaccinated cases than the corresponding HR estimated for all cases in the primary analysis. Booster vaccination with an mRNA vaccine was highly protective against hospitalisation and death in omicron cases (HR for hospital admission 8\\u201311 weeks post-booster vs unvaccinated: 0\\u00b722 [0\\u00b720\\u20130\\u00b724]), with the protection afforded after a booster not being affected by the vaccine used for doses 1 and 2.InterpretationThe risk of severe outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection is substantially lower for omicron than for delta, with higher reductions for more severe endpoints and significant variation with age. Underlying the observed risks is a larger reduction in intrinsic severity (in unvaccinated individuals) counterbalanced by a reduction in vaccine effectiveness. Documented previous SARS-CoV-2 infection offered some protection against hospitalisation and high protection against death in unvaccinated individuals, but only offered additional protection in vaccinated individuals for the death endpoint. Booster vaccination with mRNA vaccines maintains over 70% protection against hospitalisation and death in breakthrough confirmed omicron infections.FundingMedical Research Council, UK Research and Innovation, Department of Health and Social Care, National Institute for Health Research, Community Jameel, and Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(22)00462-7\", \"publication_date\": \"2022-04-01\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W3199283396\", \"doi_x\": \"10.3390/ph14100953\", \"af_direct_citation\": 1, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"The Novel Application of Geometric Morphometrics with Principal Component Analysis to Existing G Protein-Coupled Receptor (GPCR) Structures\", \"abstract\": \"The G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily is a large group of membrane proteins which, because of their vast involvement in cell signalling pathways, are implicated in a plethora of disease states and are therefore considered to be key drug targets.

Greater knowledge and understanding of their intricate structural rearrangements will therefore undoubtedly aid structure-based drug design against GPCRs.

This was conducted by assessing shape changes at the extra- and intracellular faces of the transmembrane helix bundle, analysing the XYZ coordinates of the amino acids at those positions. We have demonstrated that GPCR structures can be classified based on characteristics such as activation state, bound ligands and fusion proteins, with the most significant results focussed at the intracellular face. Conversely, our analyses provide evidence that thermostabilising mutations do not cause significant differences when compared to non-mutated GPCRs.

A topical example is the phase separation of intrinsically-disordered proteins into biomolecular condensates, which is proposed to underlie the membraneless compartmentalisation of many cellular functions. How a cell reliably controls biochemical reactions in compartments open to the compositionally-varying cytoplasm is an important question for understanding cellular homeostasis. Computer simulations are often used to study the phase behaviour of model biomolecular condensates, but the number of relevant parameters explodes as the number of protein components increases. It is unfeasible to exhaustively simulate such models for all parameter combinations, although interesting phenomena are almost certainly hidden in the jungle of their high-dimensional parameter space. Here we have studied the phase behaviour of a model biomolecular condensate in the presence of a polymeric crowding agent. We used a novel compute framework to execute dozens of simultaneous simulations spanning the protein/crowder concentration space. We then combined the results into a graphical representation for human interpretation, which provided an efficient way to search the model\\u2019s high-dimensional parameter space. We found that steric repulsion from the crowder drives a near-critical system across the phase boundary, but the molecular arrangement within the resulting biomolecular condensate is rather insensitive to the crowder concentration and molecular weight.

We set out to understand the physical mechanisms involved in translating the changes in ESCRT-III polymer composition into membrane deformation. We have built a coarse-grained model in which ESCRT-III polymers of different geometries and mechanical properties are allowed to copolymerise and bind to a deformable membrane. By modelling ATP-driven stepwise depolymerisation of specific polymers, we identify mechanical regimes in which changes in filament composition trigger the associated membrane transition from a flat to a buckled state, and then to a tubule state that eventually undergoes scission to release a small cargo-loaded vesicle. We then characterise how the location and kinetics of polymer loss affects the extent of membrane deformation and the efficiency of membrane neck scission.

This work advances our understanding of how subtle differences in protein sequence and structure can have profound effects on protein activity, which can in turn result in widespread mechanistic changes.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1002/prot.26429\", \"publication_date\": \"2022-10-06\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4323036511\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1093/genetics/iyad031\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 2, \"title\": \"The Gene Ontology knowledgebase in 2023\", \"abstract\": \"The Gene Ontology (GO) knowledgebase (http://geneontology.org) is a comprehensive resource concerning the functions of genes and gene products (proteins and noncoding RNAs).

IntroductionSpecies in the oomycete genus Phytophthora cause many devastating plant diseases. For example, P. infestans, P. parasitica, P. cactorum, P. ramorum, P. sojae, P. palmivora, and P. megakarya cause potato and tomato late blight, tobacco black shank disease, strawberry crown and leather rot, sudden oak death, soybean root and stem rot, and cacao black pod disease, respectively. P. infestans and P. sojae infect few plant species, while others such as P. parasitica, P. ramorum, and P. palmivora have a broad host range (Kamoun et al., 2015Kamoun S. Furzer O. Jones J.D.G. Judelson H.S. Ali G.S. Dalio R.J.D. Roy S.G. Schena L. Zambounis A. Panabi\\u00e8res F. et al.The Top 10 oomycete pathogens in molecular plant pathology.Mol. Plant Pathol. 2015; 16: 413-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar).Plant immunity involves detection of pathogen-derived molecules by either cell-surface pattern recognition immune receptors or intracellular nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat-containing (NLR) immune receptors, which activate either pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) or effector-triggered immunity (ETI), respectively (Jones and Dangl, 2006Jones J.D.G. Dangl J.L. The plant immune system.Nature. 2006; 444: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (8005) Google Scholar). So far, more than 20 Resistance to P. infestans (Rpi) genes were cloned from wild Solanum species that confer resistance against potato late blight (Vleeshouwers et al., 2011Vleeshouwers V.G.A.A.

Phytopathol. 2011; 49: 507-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Several Resistance genes against P. sojae (Rps) have also been mapped in different soybean accessions, and a few were cloned (Sahoo et al., 2017Sahoo D.K. Abeysekara N.S. Cianzio S.R. Robertson A.E.

In tobacco, the black shank resistance genes Phl, Php, and Ph were genetically mapped, but not yet cloned; these confer race-specific resistance to P. parasitica (also known as [aka] P. nicotianae) isolates (Gallup and Shew, 2010Gallup C.A.

For P. palmivora, some resistant cacao (Theobroma cacao) accessions were identified, but no dominant R genes have been defined or cloned (Thevenin et al., 2012Thevenin J.-M. Rossi V. Ducamp M. Doare F. Condina V. Lachenaud P.

In summary, apart from Rpi genes, very few R genes against Phytophthora pathogens have been cloned.Solanum americanum and Solanum nigrum are wild Solanaceae species and are highly resistant to P. infestans (Witek et al., 2016Witek K. Jupe F. Witek A.I. Baker D. Clark M.D. Jones J.D.G. Accelerated cloning of a potato late blight\\u2013resistance gene using RenSeq and SMRT sequencing.Nat.

Two Rpi genes of coiled-coil (CC) type, Rpi-amr3 and Rpi-amr1, were cloned from different S. americanum accessions; both confer late blight resistance in cultivated potato (Witek et al., 2016Witek K. Jupe F. Witek A.I. Baker D. Clark M.D. Jones J.D.G. Accelerated cloning of a potato late blight\\u2013resistance gene using RenSeq and SMRT sequencing.Nat.

Heal R. et al.A complex resistance locus in Solanum americanum recognizes a conserved Phytophthora effector.Nat. Plants. 2021; 7: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). S. nigrum is a hexaploid species that was thought to be a \\u201cnon-host\\u201d plant of P. infestans. No Rpi gene had been cloned from S. nigrum until we reported the functional Rpi-amr1 homolog Rpi-nig1 (Witek et al., 2021Witek K. Lin X. Karki H.S. Jupe F. Witek A.I. Steuernagel B.

Plants. 2021; 7: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).In oomycetes, the recognized effectors are usually secreted RXLR (Arg-X-Leu-Arg, X represents any amino acid)-EER (Glu-Glu-Arg) proteins that are translocated into plant cells (Rehmany et al., 2005Rehmany A.P. Gordon A. Rose L.E. Allen R.L. Armstrong M.R. Whisson S.C. Kamoun S. Tyler B.M. Birch P.R.J. Beynon J.L.

Bot. 2019; 70: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Dozens of Avirulence (Avr) genes encoding recognized effectors from Phytophthora species have been identified, and they are typically fast-evolving and lineage-specific molecules (Jiang et al., 2008Jiang R.H.Y. Tripathy S. Govers F. Tyler B.M. RXLR effector reservoir in two Phytophthora species is dominated by a single rapidly evolving superfamily with more than 700 members.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 4874-4879Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Recently, AVRamr1 (PITG_07569), the recognized effector of Rpi-amr1, was identified by a cDNA pathogen enrichment sequencing approach (Lin et al., 2020Lin X. Song T. Fairhead S. Witek K. Jouet A. Jupe F. Witek A.I. Karki H.S. Vleeshouwers V.G.A.A. Hein I. et al.Identification of Avramr1 from Phytophthora infestans using long read and cDNA pathogen-enrichment sequencing (PenSeq).Mol. Plant Pathol. 2020; 21: 1502-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, AVRamr1 homologs were identified from P. parasitica and P. cactorum genomes, and both are recognized by all Rpi-amr1 variants (Witek et al., 2021Witek K. Lin X. Karki H.S. Jupe F. Witek A.I. Steuernagel B. Stam R. van Oosterhout C. Fairhead S. Heal R. et al.A complex resistance locus in Solanum americanum recognizes a conserved Phytophthora effector.Nat. Plants. 2021; 7: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Similarly, AVR3a-like effectors were found in different Phytophthora species, including P. capsici and P. sojae, and the recognition of AVR3a homologs correlates with P. capsici or P. sojae resistance in Nicotiana species and soybean (Shan et al., 2004Shan W. Cao M. Leung D. Tyler B.M. The Avr1b locus of Phytophthora sojae encodes an elicitor and a regulator required for avirulence on soybean plants carrying resistance gene Rps1b.Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2004; 17: 394-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar; Vega-Arregu\\u00edn et al., 2014Vega-Arregu\\u00edn J.C. Jalloh A. Bos J.I. Moffett P. Recognition of an Avr3a homologue plays a major role in mediating nonhost resistance to Phytophthora capsici in Nicotiana species.Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2014; 27: 770-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, AVRblb2 homologs from P. andina and P. mirabilis trigger a hypersensitive response (HR) with Rpi-blb2 (Oliva et al., 2015Oliva R.F. Cano L.M. Raffaele S. Win J. Bozkurt T.O. Belhaj K. Oh S.-K. THINES M. Kamoun S. A recent expansion of the RXLR effector gene Avrblb2 is maintained in global populations of Phytophthora infestans indicating different contributions to virulence.Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2015; 28: 901-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Remarkably, a single N336Y mutation in R3a expands its recognition specificity to a P. capsici AVR3a homolog (Segretin et al., 2014Segretin M.E. Pais M. Franceschetti M. Chaparro-Garcia A. Bos J.I.B. Banfield M.J. Kamoun S. Single amino acid mutations in the potato immune receptor R3a expand response to Phytophthora effectors.Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2014; 27: 624-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These reports raise intriguing questions. Could RXLR effectors be widely conserved molecules among different Phytophthora species? Could these effectors be recognized by the same plant immune receptor? Of particular interest, could such effector recognition capacity enable disease resistance?Here we show that Rpi-amr3 confers resistance to all tested late blight isolates in both the field and laboratory conditions. We also identified AVRamr3, a novel AVR protein from P. infestans, by screening an RXLR effector library. AVRamr3 is a broadly conserved effector found in 13 different Phytophthora species. We also show functional Rpi-amr3 genes are widely distributed among S. americanum and S. nigrum accessions. The recognition of AVRamr3 not only enables resistance to a wide range of P. infestans isolates but also to other economically important Phytophthora pathogens such as tobacco black shank disease and cacao black pod disease pathogens P. parasitica and P. palmivora. Rpi-amr3 is the first reported R gene that confers resistance against P. parasitica and P. palmivora.ResultsRpi-amr3 confers late blight resistance in the laboratory and field conditionsRpi-amr3 was cloned by SMRT-RenSeq and reported to confer resistance against two Phytophthora infestans isolates, 88069 and 06_3928A, in a diploid potato line (Line 26, Solynta B.V.) (Witek et al., 2016Witek K. Jupe F. Witek A.I. Baker D. Clark M.D. Jones J.D.G. Accelerated cloning of a potato late blight\\u2013resistance gene using RenSeq and SMRT sequencing.Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) in the laboratory conditions. However, whether Rpi-amr3 confers broad-spectrum and field resistance to late blight was not reported.To address this, we transformed Rpi-amr3 with its native promoter and terminator into a favored UK potato cultivar cv. Maris Piper. Two lines (SLJ24895-5C and SLJ24895-9A) (Supplemental Figure 1B) were selected for a field experiment in 2017, and SLJ24895-5C was further tested in the field in 2018 (Figure 1A ). These field trials indicate that Rpi-amr3 confers protection against potato late blight in field conditions, while the wild-type Maris Piper control lines were infected completely within \\u223c3 weeks once disease symptoms appeared (Figures 1A and 1B). As a result, the tuber yield of the Rpi-amr3 transgenic lines was significantly higher than the wild-type Maris Piper lines (Figures 1C and 1D). To determine the P. infestans genotypes present in the field trial, we sampled the infected leaves and genotyped them by SSR markers; most of the isolates corresponded to a dominant UK strain 6_A1 (aka Pink6) (Supplemental Table 1).To further evaluate the resistance spectrum of Rpi-amr3, we performed detached leaf assay (DLA) on SLJ24895-5C, with wild-type Maris Piper and Rpi-amr1 transgenic Maris Piper as controls. Seventeen P. infestans isolates with different origins and races were tested (Figure 1E, Supplemental Table 2). Our results show that Rpi-amr3 confers resistance against all tested isolates in potato in laboratory conditions but with different efficacy, and Rpi-amr3-mediated resistance is weaker than Rpi-amr1 in potato (Figure 1E). We also generated Rpi-amr3 stably transformed N. benthamiana lines. Two homozygous T2 lines, 13.3 and 16.5, were tested with nine P. infestans isolates. Both Rpi-amr3 transgenic N. benthamiana lines confer complete resistance to all tested P. infestans isolates (Supplemental Table 2).These data show that Rpi-amr3 confers potato late blight resistance in both the laboratory and field conditions.Avramr3 encodes a conserved RXLR-WY effector proteinTo identify the effector recognized by Rpi-amr3, we screened an RXLR effector library (Rietman, 2011Rietman H.

Plant Pathol. 2020; 21: 1502-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) of 311 RXLR effectors by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated co-expression with Rpi-amr3 in N. benthamiana. Most of these effectors (296/311) do not induce a HR when expressed alone or co-expressed with Rpi-amr3; 14 effectors are auto-active in N. benthamiana, and we found PITG_21190 specifically induces an HR with Rpi-amr3 (Figure 2A, Supplemental Table 3); therefore, we concluded that PITG_21190 is Avramr3. Avramr3 encodes a 339-amino acid (aa) protein with a signal peptide followed by RXLR, EER motifs, and four predicted WY motifs (Win et al., 2012Win J. Krasileva K.V. Kamoun S. Shirasu K.

Sequence divergent RXLR effectors share a structural fold conserved across plant pathogenic oomycete Species.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8: e1002400Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (Figure 2C). To characterize the expression profile of Avramr3, eight P. infestans isolates (T30-4, 88069, NL01096, 06_3928A, 6_A1, EC1, US23, and 99183) were used to inoculate a susceptible potato cultivar Maris Piper; RNA was isolated 2 days after the infection for RT\\u2013PCR. Our data show that Avramr3 are expressed in all eight isolates at 2 days after infection (Supplemental Figure 1A).Figure 2Identification and characterization of AVRamr3.Show full caption(A) Co-expression of Rpi-amr3:HA and AVRamr3:HIS-FLAG triggers cell death on N. benthamiana; Rpi-amr1 and AVRamr1 were used as controls.

To study the sequence polymorphism of Avramr3, we identified 17 additional Avramr3 homologs from 11 isolates from published databases (KR_1, 3928A, EC1, 6_A1, and US23) (Lee et al., 2020Lee Y.

The sequence alignment shows Avramr3 is a highly conserved RXLR effector among P. infestans isolates, with only two polymorphic amino acids found among the 18 AVRamr3 homologs (Supplemental Figure 2).To define the domain responsible for recognition by Rpi-amr3, we fused 10 truncated Avramr3 fragments with HIS-FLAG tags and cloned into an expression vector with 35S promoter (T1\\u2013T10; Figure 2C; Supplemental Figure 3) and transiently co-expressed with Rpi-amr3 in N. benthamiana. Six AVRamr3 truncations (T1, T2, T5, T6, T7, and T9) cannot be recognized by Rpi-amr3 (Figure 2B). The protein levels of HIS-FLAG-tagged T6 and T7 are lower than others (Supplemental Figure 3A); therefore, we generated GFP-tagged constructs. The expression of T6-GFP is comparable with AVRamr3-GFP, but T7-GFP is not stable (Supplemental Figure 3B and 3C). We found four AVRamr3 truncations (T3, T4, T8, and T10) can be recognized by Rpi-amr3. T10 (111\\u2013240 aa), which carries the second and third WY motifs, is the minimal region to be recognized by Rpi-amr3, but not the adjacent T9 protein (130\\u2013258 aa) (Figure 2B). This suggests these 130 aa of AVRamr3 T10 are sufficient for recognition by Rpi-amr3 and initiation of HR.Rpi-amr3 is dependent on the helper NLRs NRC2, NRC3, and NRC4In Solanaceae, the functionality of many CC-NLR proteins requires helper NLR proteins of the NRC class (Wu et al., 2017Wu C.-H.

To test whether Rpi-amr3 is NRC dependent, we co-expressed Rpi-amr3 and Avramr3 in NRC knockout N. benthamiana lines (nrc2/3_1.3.1, nrc4_185.9.1.3, nrc2/3/4_210.4.3) (Adachi et al., 2019Adachi H.

We found HR on the nrc2/3_1.3.1 and nrc4_185.9.1.3 knockout lines, but not the nrc2/3/4_210.4.3 knockout lines. Similarly, only nrc2/3/4_210.4.3 knockout lines show susceptibility to P. infestans after Rpi-amr3 transient expression (Supplemental Figure 4). These data suggest both Rpi-amr3-mediated effector recognition and resistance are supported by either NRC2, NRC3, or NRC4.Rpi-amr3 associates with AVRamr3 in plantaTo date, most Rpi proteins recognize their cognate effectors in an indirect manner, apart from the RB and IPI-O effectors (Chen et al., 2012Chen Y.

To test the interaction between Rpi-amr3 and AVRamr3, we generated and transiently co-expressed Rpi-amr3:HA and AVRamr3:HIS-FLAG epitope-tagged constructs in nrc2/3/4 knockout N. benthamiana leaves to avoid cell death. Protein was then extracted, and bi-directional co-immunoprecipitations (Co-IPs) were performed. These Co-IPs indicate that Rpi-amr3 associates with AVRamr3 bidirectionally (Figure 2D). We also tested their interaction using a split-luciferase assay. Rpi-amr3:C-luciferase (Cluc) and AVRamr3:N-luciferase (Nluc) constructs were generated and transiently expressed in the nrc2/3/4 knockout N. benthamiana. Luciferase signal was detected only when Rpi-amr3:Cluc and AVRamr3:Nluc were co-expressed (Figure 2E), but not in the negative controls. These data suggest Rpi-amr3 associates with AVRamr3 in planta, but do not exclude the possible involvement of additional proteins.Avramr3 orthologs occur in multiple Phytophthora speciesTo study the evolution of Avramr3 in Phytophthora species, we searched for Avramr3 homologs from published Phytophthora and Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis genomes. Surprisingly, we found Avramr3 homologs in many Phytophthora genomes, including P. parasitica, P. cactorum, P. palmivora, P. pluvialis, P. megakarya, P. litchii, P. ramorum, P. lateralis, P. sojae, P. capsici, and P. cinnamomi and in H. arabidopsidis. Most of the Avramr3 homologs are located at a syntenic locus (Figure 3A ). Notably, the P. infestans Avramr3-containing contig was not fully assembled; it lacks sequences on the 5\\u2032 side of Avramr3 (Figure 3A).Figure 3AVRamr3 is a conserved effector among different Phytophthora species.Show full caption(A) The synteny map of Avramr3 loci from 12 different Phytophthora genomes.

The AVRamr3 homolog from P. cinnamomi (Pcin) shows an intermediate cell death. Agrobacterium strain GV3101(pMP90) carrying different constructs was used in this experiment. OD600 = 0.5.

Expressing the effectors alone does not trigger HR in N. benthamiana (Figure 3B), but AVRamr3 homologs from P. parasitica, P. cactorum, P. palmivora, P. megakarya, P. litchii, P. sojae, P. lateralis, and P. pluvialis can induce HR when co-expressed with Rpi-amr3, respectively. The AVRamr3 homolog from P. cinnamomi triggers a weaker HR compared with other recognized AVRamr3 homologs, and the AVRamr3 homologs from P. ramorum, P. capsici, and H. arabidopsidis (Figure 3C) do not trigger Rpi-amr3-dependent HR. All these AVRamr3 homologs carry multiple WY motifs, but many polymorphic amino acids are present among these homologs.

These pending issues will benefit from the development of new approaches reviewed here, namely (i) the synthesis of GAG oligosaccharides to build large and diverse GAG libraries, (ii) GAG analysis and sequencing by mass spectrometry (e.g., ion mobility-mass spectrometry), gas-phase infrared spectroscopy, recognition tunnelling nanopores, and molecular modeling to identify bioactive GAG sequences, biophysical methods to investigate binding interfaces, and to expand our knowledge and understanding of glycocodes governing GAG molecular recognition, and (iii) artificial intelligence for in-depth investigation of GAGomic data sets and their integration with proteomics.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1021/jacsau.2c00569\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-03-02\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4292240021\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1016/j.cell.2022.07.014\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"Bacteriophages benefit from mobilizing pathogenicity islands encoding immune systems against competitors\", \"abstract\": \"Bacteria encode sophisticated anti-phage systems that are diverse and versatile and display high genetic mobility.

Some genetically complex isolates eventually became fixed over time to single surviving genotypes in culture, whereas others retained diversity although proportions of genotypes varied over time. Drug-resistance allele frequencies did not show overall directional changes, suggesting that resistance-associated costs are not the main causes of fitness differences among parasites in culture. Loss-of-function mutants emerged during culture in several of the multiple-genotype isolates, affecting genes (including AP2-HS, EPAC and SRPK1 ) for which loss-of-function mutants were previously seen to emerge in single-genotype isolates. Parasite clones were derived by limiting dilution from six of the isolates, and sequencing identified de novo variants not detected in the bulk isolate sequences. Interestingly, most of these were nonsense mutants and frameshifts disrupting the coding sequence of EPAC , the gene with the largest number of independent nonsense mutants previously identified in laboratory-adapted lines. Analysis of Identity-By-Descent to explore relatedness among clones revealed co-occurring non-identical sibling parasites, illustrative of the natural genetic structure within parasite populations.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.09.14.507918\", \"publication_date\": \"2022-09-15\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4310668128\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1016/j.cell.2022.11.010\", \"af_direct_citation\": 1, \"af_indirect_citations\": 3, \"title\": \"IFT-A structure reveals carriages for membrane protein transport into cilia\", \"abstract\": \"Intraflagellar transport (IFT) trains are massive molecular machines that traffic proteins between cilia and the cell body.

We have reported the presence of EV genome by PCR and of EV proteins by immunohistochemistry in pancreatic sections. Here we explore multiple human virus species in the Diabetes Virus Detection (DiViD) study cases using innovative methods, including virus passage in cell cultures.Six recent-onset type 1 diabetes patients (age 24-35) were included in the DiViD study. Minimal pancreatic tail resection was performed under sterile conditions. Eleven live cases (age 43-83) of pancreatic carcinoma without diabetes served as control cases. In the present study, we used EV detection methods that combine virus growth in cell culture, gene amplification and detection of virus-coded proteins by immunofluorescence. Pancreas homogenates in cell culture medium were incubated with EV-susceptible cell lines for 3 days. Two to three blind passages were performed. DNA and RNA were extracted from both pancreas tissue and cell cultures. Real-time PCR was used for detecting 20 different viral agents other than EVs (six herpesviruses, human polyomavirus [BK virus and JC virus], parvovirus B19, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis A virus, mumps, rubella, influenza A/B, parainfluenza 1-4, respiratory syncytial virus, astrovirus, norovirus, rotavirus). EV genomes were detected by endpoint PCR using five primer pairs targeting the partially conserved 5' untranslated region genome region of the A, B, C and D species. Amplicons were sequenced. The expression of EV capsid proteins was evaluated in cultured cells using a panel of EV antibodies.Samples from six of six individuals with type 1 diabetes (cases) and two of 11 individuals without diabetes (control cases) contained EV genomes (p<0.05). In contrast, genomes of 20 human viruses other than EVs could be detected only once in an individual with diabetes (Epstein-Barr virus) and once in an individual without diabetes (parvovirus B19). EV detection was confirmed by immunofluorescence of cultured cells incubated with pancreatic extracts: viral antigens were expressed in the cytoplasm of approximately 1% of cells. Notably, infection could be transmitted from EV-positive cell cultures to uninfected cell cultures using supernatants filtered through 100 nm membranes, indicating that infectious agents of less than 100 nm were present in pancreases. Due to the slow progression of infection in EV-carrying cell cultures, cytopathic effects were not observed by standard microscopy but were recognised by measuring cell viability. Sequences of 5' untranslated region amplicons were compatible with EVs of the B, A and C species. Compared with control cell cultures exposed to EV-negative pancreatic extracts, EV-carrying cell cultures produced significantly higher levels of IL-6, IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1).Sensitive assays confirm that the pancreases of all DiViD cases contain EVs but no other viruses. Analogous EV strains have been found in pancreases of two of 11 individuals without diabetes. The detected EV strains can be passaged in series from one cell culture to another in the form of poorly replicating live viruses encoding antigenic proteins recognised by multiple EV-specific antibodies. Thus, the early phase of type 1 diabetes is associated with a low-grade infection by EVs, but not by other viral agents.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00125-022-05779-2\", \"publication_date\": \"2022-08-12\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4382133299\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1016/j.crmeth.2023.100508\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"Affinity-enhanced RNA-binding domains as tools to understand RNA recognition\", \"abstract\": \"Understanding how the RNA-binding domains of a protein regulator are used to recognize its RNA targets is a key problem in RNA biology, but RNA-binding domains with very low affinity do not perform well in the methods currently available to characterize protein-RNA interactions.

However, for many targets, AF2 models still have room for improvement. In previous CASP experiments, highly computationally intensive MD simulation-based methods have been widely used to improve the accuracy of single 3D models. Here, our ReFOLD pipeline was adapted to refine AF2 predictions while maintaining high model accuracy at a modest computational cost. Furthermore, the AF2 recycling process was utilized to improve 3D models by using them as custom template inputs for tertiary and quaternary structure predictions. Results According to the Molprobity score, 94% of the generated 3D models by ReFOLD were improved. AF2 recycling showed an improvement rate of 87.5% (using MSAs) and 81.25% (using single sequences) for monomeric AF2 models and 100% (MSA) and 97.8% (single sequence) for monomeric non-AF2 models, as measured by the average change in lDDT. By the same measure, the recycling of multimeric models showed an improvement rate of as much as 80% for AF2-Multimer (AF2M) models and 94% for non-AF2M models.

The screening at 37 to 70\\u00b0C of metagenomic fosmid libraries from above enrichment cultures identified three hydrolases (IS10, IS11, and IS12), all derived from yet-uncultured Chloroflexota and showing low sequence identity (33 to 56%) to characterized enzymes. Enzymes expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited maximal esterase activity at 70 to 90\\u00b0C, with IS11 showing the highest thermostability (90% activity after 20-min incubation at 80\\u00b0C). IS10 and IS12 were highly substrate promiscuous and hydrolyzed all 51 monoester substrates tested. Enzymes were active with PLA, polyethylene terephthalate model substrate, and mycotoxin T-2 (IS12). IS10 and IS12 had a classical \\u03b1/\\u03b2-hydrolase core domain with a serine hydrolase catalytic triad (Ser155, His280, and Asp250) in their hydrophobic active sites.

Our study identified novel thermotolerant carboxylesterases with a broad substrate range, including polyesters and mycotoxins, for potential applications in biotechnology. IMPORTANCE High-temperature-active microbial enzymes are important biocatalysts for many industrial applications, including recycling of synthetic and biobased polyesters increasingly used in textiles, fibers, coatings and adhesives. Here, we identified three novel thermotolerant carboxylesterases (IS10, IS11, and IS12) from high-temperature enrichment cultures from Ischia hydrothermal vents and incubated with biobased polymers. The identified metagenomic enzymes originated from uncultured Chloroflexota and showed low sequence similarity to known carboxylesterases. Active sites of IS10 and IS12 had the largest effective volumes among the characterized prokaryotic carboxylesterases and exhibited high substrate promiscuity, including hydrolysis of polyesters and mycotoxin T-2 (IS12). Though less promiscuous than IS10 and IS12, IS11 had a higher thermostability with a high temperature optimum (80 to 90\\u00b0C) for activity and hydrolyzed polyesters, and its crystal structure revealed an unusual lipocalin domain likely involved in substrate binding. The polyesterase activity of these enzymes makes them attractive candidates for further optimization and potential application in plastics recycling.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01704-22\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-02-28\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4213126762\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1111/febs.16396\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"Probing heavy metal binding to phycobiliproteins\", \"abstract\": \"Blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, contain some of the most efficient light-harvesting complexes known.

Together, these findings establish a conserved innate ability of RTs to catalyse de novo DNA primer synthesis, independently of accessory domains or alternative priming mechanisms, which likely plays important roles in a wide variety of biological pathways.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad478\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-06-06\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4386142056\", \"doi_x\": \"10.3390/applbiosci2030029\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 2, \"title\": \"Deregulations of RNA Pol II Subunits in Cancer\", \"abstract\": \"Deregulated transcription is a well-known characteristic of cancer cells, with differentially expressed genes being a common feature of several cancers. Often, deregulated transcription is a consequence of alterations in transcription factors (TFs), which play a crucial role in gene expression and can act as tumour suppressors or proto-oncogenes. In eukaryotic organisms, transcription is carried out by three distinct RNA polymerase complexes: Pol I, Pol II, and Pol III. Pol II, specifically, is responsible for transcribing messenger RNA (mRNA), the protein coding part of the genome, as well as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). While there is considerable research on the impact of specific deregulated transcription factors in cancer development, there is a lack of studies focusing on defects within the RNA polymerase complexes and their subunits. This review aims to shed light in particular on the Pol II complex and highlight the deregulation of its subunits that have a significant impact on tumour development, prognosis, and survival.

Genome-wide association studies link HD modification to DNA repair and mitochondrial health pathways. Recent clinical studies show elevated DNA damage in HD, even at the premanifest stage of disease. One of the major DNA repair nodes influencing neurodegenerative disease is the PARP pathway. Accumulation of poly ADP-ribose (PAR), produced by PARP1 and PARP2, has been implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer\\u2019s and Parkinson\\u2019s diseases, as well as autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia. We report that HD mutation carriers have lower cerebrospinal fluid PAR levels than healthy controls, starting at the premanifest stage. Patient-derived fibroblasts have reduced PARP1/2 activity and elevated DNA damage, while elevated PAR levels are only revealed upon inhibition of PAR degradation. These phenotypes are rescued by moderate huntingtin level reduction via the huntingtin-lowering splice modulator drug, LMI070 (Branaplam). As a direct mechanism, we have defined a PAR-binding motif in huntingtin, detected huntingtin complexed with PARylated proteins in human cells during stress, and localized huntingtin to mitotic chromosomes upon inhibition of PAR degradation. Direct huntingtin PAR binding was measured by fluorescence polarization and visualized by atomic force microscopy.

These findings emphasize that the biomarker phosphorylation sites on LRRK2 are likely reporting on the open vs closed conformation of LRRK2 kinase and that only inhibitors which stabilize the closed conformation induce dephosphorylation of these biomarker sites.

Overall, our data supports a model where HEV uses host proteases to support replication and could have evolved to be independent of a virally-encoded protease for polyprotein processing.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1011529\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-07-21\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4316465051\", \"doi_x\": \"10.3390/v15010243\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"Omicron-BA.1 Dispersion Rates in Mexico Varied According to the Regional Epidemic Patterns and the Diversity of Local Delta Subvariants\", \"abstract\": \"The Omicron subvariant BA.1 of SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in November 2021 and quickly spread worldwide, displacing the Delta variant.

One of the most potent toxins produced is the C. perfringens \\u03b2-toxin (CPB). This toxin is the main virulence factor of type C strains. We describe the cryo-electron microscopy (EM) structure of CPB oligomer. We show that CPB forms homo-octameric pores like the hetero-oligomeric pores of the bi-component leukocidins, with important differences in the receptor binding region and the N-terminal latch domain. Intriguingly, the octameric CPB pore complex contains a second 16-stranded \\u03b2-barrel protrusion atop of the cap domain that is formed by the N-termini of the eight protomers. We propose that CPB, together with the newly identified Epx toxins, is a member a new subclass of the hemolysin-like family. In addition, we show that the \\u03b2-barrel protrusion domain can be modified without affecting the pore-forming ability, thus making the pore particularly attractive for macromolecule sensing and nanotechnology. The cryo-EM structure of the octameric pore of CPB will facilitate future developments in both nanotechnology and basic research. Synopsis Clostridium perfringens \\u03b2-toxin (CPB) is a beta-pore-forming toxin of the hemolysin family and an essential virulence factor of type C strains causing fatal necrotic enteritis in animals and humans. This study reports the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the oligomeric CPB-pore which can facilitate future developments in both nanotechnology and basic research. CPB is the prototype of a novel hemolysin subfamily The N-termini of the eight protomers form a \\u03b2-barrel protrusion atop of the cap domain The membrane binding domain contains two unique flexible loops which are most likely involved in receptor specificity of CPB Introduction One of the most common and evolutionary conserved bacterial virulence mechanisms is the secretion of protein toxins that disrupt cellular membranes by pore formation. Such pore-forming toxins (PFTs) are used by the pathogens to invade, survive, and disseminate in their hosts. Despite their large diversity, bacterial PFTs share common features. Most are secreted as water-soluble monomers and bind to target cells via membrane receptors. Receptor binding leads to an increase in the local concentration, oligomerization, and insertion of a stable pore in the cell membrane. This allows uncontrolled exchanges between the extracellular and intracellular milieus, disturbs cellular homeostasis, and leads to diverse reactions ranging from defense mechanisms to cell death (Dal Peraro & van der Goot, 2016). Because of their nearly universal presence in bacterial pathogens, common structures and mechanisms used by PFTs are promising targets for novel anti-virulence strategies as alternatives or supplementation to increasingly ineffective antibiotic treatments. Moreover, PFTs have gathered much interest in the scientific community beyond bacterial infections. The nano-sized pores that they form are used for \\u201csensing\\u201d biomolecules. Many nanopore applications are based on \\u03b1-hemolysin (Hla), the prototype hemolysin-like \\u03b2-PFT secreted by Staphylococcus aureus (Kasianowicz et al, 1996) as well as aerolysin from Aeromonas hydrophila (Cao et al, 2019). The human and animal pathogen Clostridium perfringens causes many severe diseases such as wound infections, septicemia, food poisoning, enterotoxemia, and enteritis (Songer, 1996, 2010; Kiu & Hall, 2018). The bacterium can produce a large arsenal of exotoxins, in particular PFTs that cross the membrane as a \\u03b2-barrel (\\u03b2-PFT). The largest group among them, with currently 11 known members, are the hemolysin-like \\u03b2-PFTs (Popoff & Bouvet, 2009; Popoff, 2014; Mehdizadeh Gohari et al, 2015; Lacey et al, 2019). Despite their widespread use by the pathogen, their role in diseases is incompletely understood. One of the most potent toxins produced by C. perfringens is the \\u03b2-toxin (CPB; Uzal et al, 2014). CPB is secreted by C. perfringens type C strains and is essential in the pathogenesis of a lethal necrotic enteritis in many animal species and humans (Uzal et al, 2014). CPB contributes to the intestinal damages by targeting endothelial cells and potentially thrombocytes, leading to vascular damage and hemorrhage (Posthaus et al, 2020). Based on sequence homology between mature CPB and other bacterial toxins (Appendix Fig S1 and S2), the toxin is a member of the hemolysin-like family of \\u03b2-PFTs. Within this group, CPB is most closely related to C. perfringens \\u03b4-toxin (46% identity) and NetB (39% identity). In addition, it shows a 41% identity with the newly discovered enterococcal EPX4 toxin (Xiong et al, 2022). It shares lower sequence homology to the staphylococcal toxins Hla (26% identity) and the bi-component leukocidins (Notredame et al, 2000; Robert & Gouet, 2014). Recently, we determined the molecular basis for the specificity of CPB toward endothelial and leukocytic cells by showing that PECAM-1/CD31, an endothelial and leukocytic adhesion molecule, serves as its cellular receptor (Bruggisser et al, 2020; Tarek et al, 2021). So far however, no structural information has been available for CPB. In the present study, we describe the cryo-electron microscopy (EM) structure of CPB in SMA discs, which likely represents the membrane-inserted pore form, at near atomic resolution. We show that CPB forms a homo-oligomeric pore with a novel N-terminal \\u03b2-barrel replacing the typical hemolysin latch domain. We propose that the N-terminal \\u03b2-hairpin stabilizes the monomeric protein in solution and influences the pore conductivity. Our results have important implications for comparative studies on related toxins and the rational design of novel anti-virulence strategies against clostridial diseases. In addition, the unique features of the N-terminal \\u03b2-barrel make CPB an attractive candidate for applications in nanotechnology. Results and Discussion Formation of the CPB oligomeric pore To investigate the pore formed by CPB by single particle cryo-EM, we screened for a suitable detergent for oligomerization. CPB spontaneously assembles into SDS-resistant oligomeric species when stored in solution leading to partial precipitation of the protein. Purification in the presence of cholate followed by detergent removal and exchange with 2.5% SMA (Knowles et al, 2009) led to a homogeneous distribution of pores suitable for single particle cryo-EM (Fig EV1A\\u2013G). Interestingly, the synthetic nanodiscs did not require addition of lipids suggesting that the SMA is able to directly wrap around the \\u03b2-barrel of the CPB pore keeping the complex soluble. Particle distribution, orientation, and sample quality in SMA were better than either in detergent or inserted in protein-based nanodiscs (Fig EV2A\\u2013D). The average diameter of the particles was ~100 \\u00c5. Two-dimensional classification of the particles revealed CPB pores with eight-fold symmetry. Further refinement and postprocessing resulted in an electron density map at an estimated 3.8 \\u00c5 resolution (Figs 1A and C, and EV2E and F). This allowed us to unambiguously build a model for the CPB octameric pore except for two loops in the rim domain (Glu76\\u2013Ser89, Ala283\\u2013Pro287), 4N-terminal amino acids and several amino acids with unresolved side chains (Fig 1B).

Download figure Download PowerPoint Molecular architecture of the CPB pore The cryo-EM analysis of CPB clearly showed that like other members of the hemolysin-like family, the CPB protomer is composed of a cap, a rim, and a stem domain (Johnstone et al, 2021). In addition to the prototypical features of the family members, CPB possesses a second \\u03b2-barrel on top of the cap domain. While the N-terminus of Hla is located inside the cap domain and wraps the vestibule-exposed surface of the adjacent protomer, the CPB N-terminus protrudes from the cap as a short hairpin, which assembles to form a 16-strand \\u03b2-barrel (Fig 1B and D). We termed it the N-terminal \\u03b2-barrel protrusion (NBP). The cap domain consists of a \\u03b2-sandwich composed of two \\u03b2-sheets and short \\u03b1-helices. Two strands extend into the lower part of the molecule making up the rim domain. While the cap domain is one of the most conserved features within the hemolysin-like family, interesting differences are found in the rim domain. Unfolded loops in this domain have been shown to bind the toxin receptor in LukGH leukocidin (CD11b) and phosphatidyl choline in both Hla and \\u03b3-hemolysin (Trstenjak et al, 2020; Olson et al, 1999; Galdiero & Gouaux, 2004; Monma et al, 2004). Interestingly at position 210, CPB is the only family member to have a bulky aromatic residue, a tyrosine, pointing inside a pocket (Fig 1C). This pocket was shown to bind phosphocholine in Hla (Galdiero & Gouaux, 2004). Furthermore, CPB lacks a four-residue stretch which lines the pocket. Among them a tryptophan which is important for phosphocholine binding in staphylococcal hemolysins (Monma et al, 2004). These differences are compatible with the fact that CPB main receptor is a membrane protein, whereas for both \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-hemolysins the main receptor is phosphatidylcholine (Dal Peraro & van der Goot, 2016; Bruggisser et al, 2020). The loops at the base of the rim domain were well resolved except for two stretches of 14 and 5 residues, respectively (Glu76\\u2013Ser89; Ala283\\u2013Pro287). Importantly, these stretches are predicted to be surface exposed (Fig EV3A\\u2013D). (Trstenjak et al, 2020). We compared the protomer structure in CPB and \\u03b3-hemolysin octamers, respectively (Fig EV3E). The rim domain of the two proteins nearly perfectly overlaps except in the membrane-proximal loop region, suggesting that the loops have different functions between the two toxins. This may indicate that this region of CPB could potentially bind its receptor. Indeed, a pairwise flexible alignment of CPB with other hemolysins shows that apart from the NBP the main structural differences are located in the rim domain, in particular in the flexible loops of the rim (Appendix Fig S3). This issue is out of the scope of this paper and will be investigated in subsequent studies. The stem domain is similar to the other family members. It contains a long, curved amphipathic hairpin, which is connected to the cap \\u03b2-sandwich through two short coils forming the transmembrane \\u03b2-barrel upon oligomerization. Overall, the CPB octamer forms a 123 \\u00c5-long ring-like structure with a widest outer diameter of 97 \\u00c5 (Fig 1A and B). The channel runs along the 8-fold symmetry axis. It goes through the 25-\\u00c5 long N-terminal \\u00df-barrel, the central large 72,900 \\u00c53 vestibule, formed by the cap domains, and the transmembrane \\u03b2-barrel.

In the graph, the black line reports on the distances measured when using our CPB structure.

The protein rendering is colored according to the mean difference of simulated structures. Download figure Download PowerPoint N-terminal \\u03b2-barrel protrusion To further investigate the NBP and its role, we constructed CPB mutants where the NBP was either deleted (\\u039423CPB) or replaced by the equivalent N-termini of S. aureus Hla (Hla-\\u039423CPB), \\u03b3-hemolysin component B (HlgB-\\u039423CPB), or C. perfringens \\u03b4-toxin (\\u03b4-toxin-\\u039423CPB). While the modification of the N-terminus seemed to affect protein solubility in Escherichia coli, with a much lower soluble protein yield for the chimeras when compared to the WT-CPB, the cholate purified proteins still retained their ability to oligomerize and form pores (Fig 2A and B). 2D class averages of the different mutants showed the lack of the NBP density for the \\u039423CPB mutant as well as a lack of a structured N-terminus for the Hla-\\u039423CPB and HlgB-\\u039423CPB. The N-terminus from \\u03b4-toxin in the \\u03b4-toxin-\\u039423CPB chimera seems to form an NBP similar to the WT-CPB, suggesting that the N-terminus of \\u03b4-toxin oligomer might also adopt a \\u03b2-barrel conformation in its oligomeric form (Figs 2C and EV3A). Interestingly, the ability to form the NBP correlates with the cytotoxic activity. The truncated \\u039423CPB, HlgB-\\u039423CPB, and Hla-\\u039423CPB were inactive, whereas activity was fully restored for the \\u03b4-toxin-\\u039423CPB (Fig 2D). Figure 2.

Download figure Download PowerPoint Channel properties and dynamics To investigate the mechanical and physical properties of the CPB pore, we carried out atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of it inserted into a lipid bilayer. The CPB channel features four constriction points in its two \\u03b2-barrels (Fig 3A). The narrowest points have a ~ 6 \\u00c5 mean radius and are located within the NBP at the level of the positively charged Arg11 and Lys13. The channel reaches a maximum radius of about 20 \\u00c5 within the vestibule of the cap. Quantifying the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of the toxin atoms revealed that the most flexible regions are the NBP and the intracellular turns of the transmembrane \\u03b2-barrel (Fig 3B). The NBP, while maintaining its overall structure, can oscillate off-axis, whereas the pore turns can squeeze off a perfectly circular symmetry contributing to reducing the local pore radius (Fig EV4A\\u2013C). These observations are consistent with EM data obtained by performing a multibody analysis on the CPB particles and could explain the variability observed previously in the channel conductance (Shatursky et al, 2000; Fig EV2F and Movie EV1). Examining charge distribution in the pore lumen revealed a high density of positive charges inside the \\u03b2-barrel protrusion due to Arg11 and Lys13 (Fig 3C). Potential mean force (PMF) profiles for Na+, Ca2+, and Cl\\u2212 estimated via umbrella sampling indicated that this region should constitute an energy barrier for cations (4.6 kcal/mol for Na+). The wide cap vestibule features a balanced amount of positive and negative charges, while the transmembrane \\u03b2-barrel is overall negatively charged, especially due to Glu152 and Glu162. These amino acids, associated with constriction points, determine a highly negative PMF for cations (as low as \\u221224.6 kcal/mol for Ca2+) and a large 10.2 kcal/mol barrier for Cl\\u2212 in agreement with previous reports suggesting that the CPB pore is mostly permeable to cations (Shatursky et al, 2000; Manich et al, 2008).

Download figure Download PowerPoint Comparison with other hemolysins-like \\u03b2-PFTs In this study, we explored the structure of the membrane inserted oligomeric CPB and showed that it belongs to a new subclass of hemolysin-like \\u03b2-PFTs that contain an additional \\u03b2-barrel domain in its extracellular side. After our first version of the manuscript was released on a preprint server, eight novel enterococcal hemolysin-like \\u03b2-PFTs were reported (Xiong et al, 2022). Interestingly, the structure of two of them was solved and showed that they also adopt an NBP fold atop the cap domain. A structural comparison shows a remarkable structural similarity suggesting that they also belong to the CPB subfamily of hemolysin-like PFTs (Fig EV5A\\u2013C). It is of particular interest that the NBP structure of EPX1 toxin has the same fold as CPB while the NBP of EPX4 toxin is reversed. This supports our mutagenesis results that the NBP \\u03b2-barrel structure can be highly flexible. A detailed comparison of the N-terminal domains with structures of other oligomeric hemolysins is not possible. The N-terminus of the oligomeric \\u03b3-hemolysin is disordered (Yamashita et al, 2011). For NetB, oligomer crystallization was only possible after removing the first 20 amino acids of the protein (Savva et al, 2013). For C. perfringens \\u03b4-toxin, only the monomer structure is available (Huyet et al, 2013)(Savva et al, 2013). In \\u03b4-toxin soluble monomer, unlike S. aureus Hla, the N-terminus adopts a \\u03b2-hairpin conformation, which extends halfway along the cap \\u03b2-sandwich and contacts the pre-stem (Fig EV3A). Because of the high sequence similarity between CPB and C. perfringens \\u03b4-toxin (Appendix Figs S1 and S2), it is reasonable to assume that the N-terminus of CPB adopts a similar conformation in the water-soluble monomer. To gain insight into the putative structure of CPB soluble monomer, we made use of recent advances in protein structure prediction (Baek et al, 2021; Jumper et al, 2021). Both Rosetta and AlphaFold generated predictions similar to the structure of \\u03b4-toxin monomer (Fig EV3C and D) with an N-terminus folded back and forming a \\u03b2-hairpin.

However, it remains unclear whether these hybrid lineages represent recent hybridization events, suggesting hybridization is ongoing, and/or whether they represent introgressed lineages derived from ancient hybridization events. In human schistosomiasis, investigation is hampered by the inaccessibility of adult-stage worms due to their intravascular location, an issue which can be circumvented by post-mortem of livestock at abattoirs for Schistosoma spp. of known zoonotic potential. To characterise the composition of naturally-occurring schistosome hybrids, we performed whole-genome sequencing of 21 natural livestock infective schistosome isolates.

Genomic analyses identified isolates of S. bovis, S. curassoni and hybrids between the two species, all of which were early generation hybrids with multiple generations found within the same host.

Originating in early autumn but discovered in December 2020, it spread rapidly and caused large waves of infections worldwide. The Alpha variant is notable for being defined by a long ancestral phylogenetic branch with an increased evolutionary rate, along which only two sequences have been sampled. Alpha genomes comprise a well-supported monophyletic clade within which the evolutionary rate is typical of SARS-CoV-2. The Alpha epidemic continued to grow despite the continued restrictions on social mixing across the UK and the imposition of new restrictions, in particular, the English national lockdown in November 2020. While these interventions succeeded in reducing the absolute number of cases, the impact of these non-pharmaceutical interventions was predominantly to drive the decline of the SARS-CoV-2 lineages that preceded Alpha. We investigate the only two sampled sequences that fall on the branch ancestral to Alpha. We find that one is likely to be a true intermediate sequence, providing information about the order of mutational events that led to Alpha. We explore alternate hypotheses that can explain how Alpha acquired a large number of mutations yet remained largely unobserved in a region of high genomic surveillance: an under-sampled geographical location, a non-human animal population, or a chronically infected individual. We conclude that the latter provides the best explanation of the observed behaviour and dynamics of the variant, although the individual need not be immunocompromised, as persistently infected immunocompetent hosts also display a higher within-host rate of evolution. Finally, we compare the ancestral branches and mutation profiles of other VOCs and find that Delta appears to be an outlier both in terms of the genomic locations of its defining mutations and a lack of the rapid evolutionary rate on its ancestral branch. As new variants, such as Omicron, continue to evolve (potentially through similar mechanisms), it remains important to investigate the origins of other variants to identify ways to potentially disrupt their evolution and emergence.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/veac080\", \"publication_date\": \"2022-07-01\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4293168376\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1038/s41467-022-32774-3\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"A ribosomally synthesised and post-translationally modified peptide containing a \\u03b2-enamino acid and a macrocyclic motif\", \"abstract\": \"Abstract Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are structurally complex natural products with diverse bioactivities.

Studies on large cohorts of patients with comparison of their DNA to women without endometriosis or with other disorders have documented changes in genes associated with steroid hormone production or action.

In plants, most TIR domains are incorporated into intracellular immune receptors termed TNLs. In Arabidopsis, TIR-derived small molecules bind and activate EDS1 heterodimers, which in turn activate RNLs, a class of cation channel\\u2013forming immune receptors. RNL activation drives cytoplasmic Ca 2+ influx, transcriptional reprogramming, pathogen resistance, and host cell death. We screened for mutants that suppress an RNL activation mimic allele and identified a TNL, SADR1. Despite being required for the function of an autoactivated RNL, SADR1 is not required for defense signaling triggered by other tested TNLs. SADR1 is required for defense signaling initiated by some transmembrane pattern recognition receptors and contributes to the unbridled spread of cell death in lesion simulating disease 1 . Together with RNLs, SADR1 regulates defense gene expression at infection site borders, likely in a non-cell autonomous manner. RNL mutants that cannot sustain this pattern of gene expression are unable to prevent disease spread beyond localized infection sites, suggesting that this pattern corresponds to a pathogen containment mechanism. SADR1 potentiates RNL-driven immune signaling not only through the activation of EDS1 but also partially independently of EDS1. We studied EDS1-independent TIR function using nicotinamide, an NADase inhibitor. Nicotinamide decreased defense induction from transmembrane pattern recognition receptors and decreased calcium influx, pathogen growth restriction, and host cell death following intracellular immune receptor activation. We demonstrate that TIR domains can potentiate calcium influx and defense and are thus broadly required for Arabidopsis immunity.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2220921120\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-03-09\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4306641915\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1073/pnas.2210559119\", \"af_direct_citation\": 1, \"af_indirect_citations\": 2, \"title\": \"A blast fungus zinc-finger fold effector binds to a hydrophobic pocket in host Exo70 proteins to modulate immune recognition in rice\", \"abstract\": \"Exocytosis plays an important role in plant-microbe interactions, in both pathogenesis and symbiosis.

In addition, five mutations (P316A, V317A, P318A, D319A, and H323A) initially resulted in nonfunctional receptors, but the function could be rescued by coexpression with a chaperone protein, suggesting a likely role in assembly or folding.

Morphological variation can be quantified using geometric morphometric, outline or surface\\u2010based methods. These are most effective when morphological differences are relatively modest and there are numerous ubiquitous landmarks and phase aligned features of shape variation. The most disparate samples, such as those across classes and phyla, typically necessitate the use of discrete characters. Unfortunately, such characters are often compiled subjectively in a manner reflecting the level of morphological and taxonomic focus and the intensity of taxon sampling. Sampling intensity is often highly variable within a single data set, especially in repurposed and amalgamated cladistic matrices. Here, we propose indices of molecular disparity analogous to those of morphological disparity. Despite numerous shortcomings discussed here, molecular sequence data can be obtained in a more objective, automated and scalable manner than morphological data. Comparisons of the morphological and molecular disparity of subclades in 16 large data sets suggest that molecular disparity is less susceptible to sampling biases than morphological disparity. Moreover, distance matrices inferred from individual genes tend to correlate strongly with each other and with distances from all concatenated genes. By contrast, morphological and molecular disparity are typically not significantly correlated across subclades, such that comparisons for groups can help to give a fuller picture of their evolution. For example, within mammals, Afrotheria have conspicuously high morphological disparity but modest molecular disparity, suggesting unusually high morphological plasticity. Even more strikingly, the molecular disparity of rodents is over five times that for Artiodactyla, despite having only half of their morphological disparity. These contrasts suggest the differential operation of geometric, biomechanical, ontogenetic and environmental constraints on form. Given the increasing abundance of total evidence datasets in the literature and the widespread and sometimes uncritical repurposing of discrete morphological matrices, we propose the comparison of morphological and molecular disparity as a useful tool to understand subclade evolution more fully.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210x.14166\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-07-24\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4310957810\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1093/nar/gkac1080\", \"af_direct_citation\": 1, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"MGnify: the microbiome sequence data analysis resource in 2023\", \"abstract\": \"Abstract The MGnify platform (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics) facilitates the assembly, analysis and archiving of microbiome-derived nucleic acid sequences.

We further show that some of the main cellular organelles, e.g., actin/tubulin, lysosomes, mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum, are significantly functionally/structurally impaired in the presence of FUS. These may be related to defects in the tubulin network, as the latter facilitates transport, formation, fusion and fission of organelles. We observe significant increases in lysosomal biogenesis, size and pH; moreover, intracellular FUS accumulation significantly promotes cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of TFEB, i.e., the master gene for inducing autophagy. However, despite these, increased autophagy needed for protein aggregate clearance is not observed to occur.

Microorganisms represent the main source of antibiotics with applicability in agriculture and in the clinic, but many aspects of their metabolic potential remain to be explored. This report describes the discovery and characterization of a new antifungal compound, solanimycin, produced by a hybrid polyketide/nonribosomal peptide (PKS/NRPS) system in Dickeya solani, the enterobacterial pathogen of potato. Solanimycin was active against a broad range of plant-pathogenic fungi of global economic concern and the human pathogen Candida albicans. The genomic cluster responsible for solanimycin production was defined and analyzed to identify the corresponding biosynthetic proteins, which include four multimodular PKS/NRPS proteins and several tailoring enzymes. Antifungal production in D. solani was enhanced in response to experimental conditions found in infected potato tubers and high-density fungal cultures. Solanimycin biosynthesis was cell density dependent in D. solani and was controlled by both the ExpIR acyl-homoserine lactone and Vfm quorum-sensing systems of the bacterial phytopathogen. The expression of the solanimycin cluster was also regulated at the post-transcriptional level, with the regulator RsmA playing a major role. The solanimycin biosynthetic cluster was conserved across phylogenetically distant bacterial genera, and multiple pieces of evidence support that the corresponding gene clusters were acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Given its potent broad-range antifungal properties, this study suggests that solanimycin and related molecules may have potential utility for agricultural and clinical exploitation. IMPORTANCE Fungal infections represent a major clinical, agricultural, and food security threat worldwide, which is accentuated due to the difficult treatment of these infections. Microorganisms represent a prolific source of antibiotics, and current data support that this enormous biosynthetic potential has been scarcely explored. To improve the performance in the discovery of novel antimicrobials, there is a need to diversify the isolation niches for new antibiotic-producing microorganisms as well as to scrutinize novel phylogenetic positions. With the identification of the antifungal antibiotic solanimycin in a broad diversity of phytopathogenic Dickeya spp., we provide further support for the potential of plant-associated bacteria for the biosynthesis of novel antimicrobials. The complex regulatory networks involved in solanimycin production reflect the high metabolic cost of bacterial secondary metabolism. This metabolic regulatory control makes many antibiotics cryptic under standard laboratory conditions, and mimicking environmental conditions, as shown here, is a strategy to activate cryptic antibiotic clusters.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02472-22\", \"publication_date\": \"2022-12-20\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4381470302\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1128/spectrum.04858-22\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"Absence of Staphylococcus aureus in Wild Populations of Fish Supports a Spillover Hypothesis\", \"abstract\": \"Staphylococcus aureus is a human and livestock commensal but also an important pathogen responsible for high human mortality rates and economic losses in farming.

Standard GWAS are well-powered to interrogate additive models; however, new approaches are required to investigate other modes of inheritance such as dominance and epistasis. Epistasis, or non-additive interaction between genes, exists across the genome but often goes undetected due to lack of statistical power. Furthermore, the adoption of LD pruning as customary in standard GWAS excludes detection of sites in LD that may underlie the genetic architecture of complex traits. We hypothesize that uncovering long-range interactions between loci with strong LD due to epistatic selection can elucidate genetic mechanisms underlying common diseases. To investigate this hypothesis, we tested for associations between 23 common diseases and 5,625,845 epistatic SNP-SNP pairs (determined by Ohta\\u2019s D statistics) in long-range LD (&gt; 0.25cM). We identified five significant associations across five disease phenotypes that replicated in two large genotype-phenotype datasets (UK Biobank and eMERGE). The genes that were most likely involved in the replicated associations were 1) members of highly conserved gene families with complex roles in multiple pathways, 2) essential genes, and/or 3) associated in the literature with complex traits that display variable expressivity. These results support the highly pleiotropic and conserved nature of variants in long-range under epistatic selection. Our work supports the hypothesis that epistatic interactions regulate diverse clinical mechanisms and may especially be driving factors in conditions with a wide range of phenotypic outcomes. Significance Current knowledge of genotype-phenotype relationships is largely contingent on traditional univariate approaches to genomic analysis. Yet substantial evidence supports non-additive modes of inheritance and regulation, such as epistasis, as being abundant across the genome. In this genome-wide study, we probe the biomolecular mechanisms underlying complex human diseases by testing the association of pairwise genetic interactions with disease occurrence in large-scale biobank data. Specifically, we tested intrachromosomal and interchrosomal long-range interactions between regions of the genome in high linkage disequilibrium, these regions are typically excluded from genomic analyses. The results from this study suggest that essential gene, members of highly conserved gene families, and phenotypes with variable expressivity, are particularly enriched with epistatic and pleiotropic activity.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.19.22280888\", \"publication_date\": \"2022-10-21\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4385684007\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1098/rsif.2023.0187\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 2, \"title\": \"Modelling the viral dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants in different cell types\", \"abstract\": \"We use viral kinetic models fitted to viral load data from in vitro studies to explain why the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant replicates faster than the Delta variant in nasal cells, but slower than Delta in lung cells, which could explain Omicron's higher transmission potential and lower severity.

Heterologous gene expression confirmed that AcyN is involved in ascocorynin production but only produces the non-hydroxylated precursor polyporic acid.

Accordingly, heterologous co-expression of acyN and the monooxygenase gene resulted in the production of ascocorynin. Structural modelling of the monooxygenase suggests that the hydrophobic substrate polyporic acid enters the monooxygenase from a membrane facing entry site and is converted into the more hydrophilic product ascocorynin, which prevents its re-entry for a second round of hydroxylation.This study characterises the first naturally occurring polyporic acid synthetase from an ascomycete.

We used an ALS-associated mutant FUS(P525L) and the FTD-mimic hypomethylated FUS, FUS(16R), to investigate the common and distinct cytoskeletal changes found in these two reported Xenopus models. Combining a novel atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based approach for in vitro cytoskeletal characterisation and in vivo axonal branching analysis, we found that mutant FUS reduced actin density in the dynamically remodelling growth cone, and reduced axonal branch complexity.

Despite the applied importance of cross-resistance, its evolutionary underpinnings remain poorly understood. Here we reveal how a single gene evolved the capacity to detoxify two structurally unrelated insecticides with different MoA. Using transgenic approaches we demonstrate that a specific variant of the cytochrome P450 CYP6ER1, previously shown to confer resistance to the neonicotinoid imidacloprid in the brown planthopper, N. lugens, also confers cross-resistance to the phenylpyrazole ethiprole. CYP6ER1 is duplicated in resistant strains, and we show that while the acquisition of mutations in two encoded substrate recognition sites (SRS) of one of the parologs led to resistance to imidacloprid, a different set of mutations, outside of known SRS, are primarily responsible for resistance to ethiprole. Epistatic interactions between these mutations and their genetic background suggest that the evolution of dual resistance from the same gene copy involved functional trade-offs in respect to CYP6ER1 catalytic activity for ethiprole versus imidacloprid. Surprisingly, the mutations leading to ethiprole and imidacloprid resistance do not confer the ability to detoxify the insecticide fipronil, another phenylpyrazole with close structural similarity to ethiprole.

Here we show that protein modelling using Alphafold-Multimer (AF2-multimer) identifies both canonical and atypical AIM/LIR motifs with a high level of accuracy. AF2-multimer can be modified to detect additional functional AIM/LIR motifs by using protein sequences with mutations in primary AIM/LIR residues. By combining protein modelling data from AF2-multimer with phylogenetic analysis of protein sequences and protein-protein interaction assays, we demonstrate that AF2-multimer predicts the physiologically relevant AIM motif in the ATG8-interacting protein 2 (ATI-2) as well as the previously uncharacterized non-canonical AIM motif in ATG3 from potato ( Solanum tuberosum ). AF2-multimer also identified the AIM/LIR motifs in pathogen-encoded virulence factors that target ATG8 members in their plant and human hosts, revealing that cross-kingdom ATG8-LIR/AIM associations can also be predicted by AF2-multimer. We conclude that the AF2-guided discovery of autophagy adaptors/receptors will substantially accelerate our understanding of the molecular basis of autophagy in all biological kingdoms.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.09.25.509395\", \"publication_date\": \"2022-09-26\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4366992750\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1111/nph.18921\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"Manipulation of plant immunity via an <scp>mRNA</scp> decapping pathogen effector\", \"abstract\": \"This article is a Commentary on McCombe et al .

Given the excellent efficiency of the natural photosynthetic apparatus, biohybrid photovoltaic devices present an attractive solution for solar energy conversion. However, their composition, stability, and complexity can limit their inclusion into photovoltaic devices. Here, we combined computational design and directed evolution to overcome these limitations and create tailor-made photoenzymes. Photo-biocatalysts were designed by introducing photosensitizer binding sites into heme-containing helical bundle proteins. The designed binding sites were specific for the target photosensitizer and readily transplanted into other helical bundles. The best design was highly evolvable and reached nanomolar ligand affinity after mutagenesis and screening. The evolved enzyme generated 2.6 times higher photocurrents than the photosensitizer alone, primarily driven by increased photostability. Evolvability is a unique advantage of our protein-based approach over abiological photovoltaic and will be critical to developing efficient biohybrid systems.

This organism is also a major cause of airway infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Pa is known to have a remarkable metabolic plasticity, allowing it to thrive under diverse environmental conditions and ecological niches; yet, little is known about the central metabolic pathways that sustain its growth during infection or precisely how these pathways operate. In this work, we used a combination of 'omics approaches (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and 13C-fluxomics) and reverse genetics to provide systems-level insight into how the infection-relevant organic acids succinate and propionate are metabolized by Pa. Moreover, through structural and kinetic analysis of the 2-methylcitrate synthase (2-MCS; PrpC) and its paralogue citrate (CIT) synthase (GltA), we show how these two crucial enzymatic steps are interconnected in Pa organic acid assimilation. We found that Pa can rapidly adapt to the loss of GltA function by acquiring mutations in a transcriptional repressor, which then derepresses prpC expression. Our findings provide a clear example of how \\\"underground metabolism,\\\" facilitated by enzyme substrate promiscuity, \\\"rewires\\\" Pa metabolism, allowing it to overcome the loss of a crucial enzyme. This pathogen-specific knowledge is critical for the advancement of a model-driven framework to target bacterial central metabolism. IMPORTANCE Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen that, due to its unrivalled resistance to antibiotics, ubiquity in the built environment, and aggressiveness in infection scenarios, has acquired the somewhat dubious accolade of being designated a \\\"critical priority pathogen\\\" by the WHO. In this work, we uncover the pathways and mechanisms used by P. aeruginosa to grow on a substrate that is abundant at many infection sites: propionate. We found that if the organism is prevented from metabolizing propionate, the substrate turns from being a convenient nutrient source into a potent poison, preventing bacterial growth. We further show that one of the enzymes involved in these reactions, 2-methylcitrate synthase (PrpC), is promiscuous and can moonlight for another essential enzyme in the cell (citrate synthase). Indeed, mutations that abolish citrate synthase activity (which would normally prevent the cell from growing) can be readily overcome if the cell acquires additional mutations that increase the expression of PrpC.

We replaced GAP residues near the active site and determined the activation barrier for 190 single mutants. We furthermore built a machine learning for ultrafast screening, by fast prediction of the barrier heights, tested both on the single and double mutations. This work demonstrates that fast and accurate screening can be accomplished via QM/MM reaction path optimizations to design protein sequences with increased catalytic activity.

In unperturbed cells, the 7K-patch is targeted for KAT2A/2B-mediated acetylation, which in turn enhances the direct association of PALB2 with nucleosomes. Importantly, DNA damage triggers a rapid deacetylation of ChAM and increases the overall mobility of PALB2. Distinct missense mutations of the 7K-patch render the mode of PALB2 chromatin binding, making it either unstably chromatin-bound (7Q) or randomly bound with a reduced capacity for mobilisation (7R). Significantly, both of these mutations confer a deficiency in RAD51 foci formation and increase DNA damage in S phase, leading to the reduction of overall cell survival.

Using an incross of haplotype-resolved wild-type fish, we found evidence of widespread allele-specific expression, which appears as differential expression when comparing embryos homozygous for a region of the genome to their siblings. When analysing mutant transcriptomes, this means that the differential expression of genes on the same chromosome as a mutation of interest may not be caused by that mutation. Typically, the genomic location of a differentially expressed gene is not considered when interpreting its importance with respect to the phenotype. This could lead to pathways being erroneously implicated or overlooked due to the noise of spurious differentially expressed genes on the same chromosome as the mutation. These observations have implications for the interpretation of RNA-seq experiments involving outbred animals and non-inbred model organisms.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.72825\", \"publication_date\": \"2022-02-17\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4306641762\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1073/pnas.2210109119\", \"af_direct_citation\": 1, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"Cryo-EM structures of light-harvesting 2 complexes from <i>Rhodopseudomonas palustris</i> reveal the molecular origin of absorption tuning\", \"abstract\": \"The genomes of some purple photosynthetic bacteria contain a multigene puc family encoding a series of \\u03b1- and \\u03b2-polypeptides that together form a heterogeneous antenna of light-harvesting 2 (LH2) complexes.

With the introduction of ANSURR, we have a tool that increases our confidence in measuring whether new methods are effective. In this paper, we take the first step in implementing this idea, by addressing one experimental restraint that has proved difficult to implement, namely hydrogen bond restraints (HBRs). The most widely used restraints for NMR structure calculation are nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs). These are easily obtained from nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra and have (in principle) a simple interpretation, in that under appropriate conditions, an NOE peak denotes the close distance between two protons, with an intensity proportional to r\\u22126, where r is the internuclear distance.4Neuhaus D. Williamson M.P. The Nuclear Overhauser Effect in Structural and Conformational Analysis, 2nd Edition. Wiley-VCH, 2000Google Scholar Another common restraint is to use backbone chemical shifts to produce restraints on dihedral angles, for example using TALOS-N.5Shen Y. Bax A. Protein backbone and sidechain torsion angles predicted from NMR chemical shifts using artificial neural networks.J. Biomol. NMR. 2013; 56: 227-241https://doi.org/10.1007/s10858-013-9741-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar Hydrogen bonds are one of the few other common restraints and are very strong, because the distances are short and have a small range between upper and lower bounds. Restraint violations therefore typically become unfavorable with relatively small changes in geometry. For this reason, HBRs should be applied with caution, because they effectively force the relevant groups to form a hydrogen bond. Hydrogen bonds are more difficult restraints to apply than NOEs because they cannot usually be obtained directly from experimental data. NOE restraints come directly from NOESY spectra and dihedral restraints from backbone chemical shifts. It is possible to observe hydrogen bonds directly from observation of 3J across the hydrogen bond.6Cordier F. Grzesiek S. Direct observation of hydrogen bonds in proteins by interresidue 3hJNC ' scalar couplings.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1601-1602https://doi.org/10.1021/ja983945dCrossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar However, the coupling constant is small and for most proteins the signal is too weak to be detected. Therefore the presence of a hydrogen bond has to be inferred. Hydrogen bonds in regular secondary structure can be predicted based on NOE patterns in the vicinity,7W\\u00fcthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W. Polypeptide secondary structure determination by nuclear magnetic resonance observation of short proton-proton distances.J. Mol.

Temperature dependence of 1H chemical shifts in proteins.J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 359-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar Neither of these is completely reliable, meaning that any inference of a hydrogen bond is potentially wrong. Significantly, amide exchange and temperature coefficients identify the amide group but do not identify the carbonyl donor. Therefore for most hydrogen bonds, identification of the donor is based on inferences not direct observation. For these reasons, NMR spectroscopists have generally been cautious in applying HBRs in protein structure calculation. There is no \\u201cstandard protocol,\\u201d but typically HBRs are only applied toward the end of the calculation, the suspicion being that it may not be scientifically justified to use them as part of the standard structure calculation. There has thus emerged a sense that HBRs are not as \\u201crespectable\\u201d as NOEs or dihedral restraints, as a result of which, the details of hydrogen bond restraints are often deeply buried in papers, and it is often very hard to work out from the literature exactly how HBRs were generated and used. This is a pity, because HBRs are such powerful restraints, and therefore very useful if used correctly. The main aim of this work is to propose a justifiable and transparent protocol. We describe a robust iterative approach to the addition of HBRs, monitored using ANSURR, and demonstrate the effect of HBRs on the structure calculation of the SH2 domain from SH2B1. We show that the accuracy of the structures improves as HBRs are added. SH2B1 is a signaling scaffold protein that acts downstream of the insulin and leptin receptors11Maures T.J. Kurzer J.H.

It is also an example of a well-studied domain with a crystal structure. For the purposes of this study this is useful because the crystal structure provides us with a useful guide to accuracy. The aim of this study is to present an iterative approach to introducing hydrogen bond restraints (HBRs) into an NMR structure calculation, and to investigate whether this improves the accuracy of the structure. Our primary measure of accuracy is ANSURR. ANSURR calculates the rigidity of a protein structure using the algorithm Floppy Inclusions and Rigid Substructure Topography (FIRST)15Jacobs D.J. Rader A.J. Kuhn L.A. Thorpe M.F.

The comparison uses two measures: correlation, which calculates the extent to which peaks and troughs in rigidity along the sequence match, and is primarily a measure of the correctness of local secondary structure; and RMSD, which compares rigidity along the sequence (Figure S1). Our previous studies1Fowler N.J. Sljoka A. Williamson M.P. A method for validating the accuracy of NMR protein structures.Nat.

We suggested that a major cause of this floppiness is that NMR structures have too few hydrogen bonds, in comparison to either crystal structures2Fowler N.J. Sljoka A. Williamson M.P.

Before starting these structure calculations, we therefore undertook a more thorough study of the relationship between hydrogen bond content and accuracy. A set of 215 pairs of published NMR and X-ray structures was assembled (Table S1). This set was used to compute the average hydrogen bond correctness of each NMR ensemble, defined as the average percentage of hydrogen bonds in an X-ray structure that appear in an NMR ensemble. This calculation relies on the assumption that the hydrogen bonds in a crystal structure are also present in solution, which is clearly not completely true, but is a good approximation.1Fowler N.J. Sljoka A. Williamson M.P. A method for validating the accuracy of NMR protein structures.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 6321https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20177-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar We computed the average ANSURR score (the sum of correlation and RMSD scores, and thus a ranked score out of 200) for each ensemble and compared this to the average hydrogen bond correctness. Figure 1A shows that NMR structures with higher hydrogen bond correctness tend to be more accurate as measured by ANSURR, and also indicates that the hydrogen bonds in X-ray structures generally represent those that appear in solution. Plotting the number of hydrogen bonds per residue in each ensemble against hydrogen bond correctness (Figure 1B) demonstrates that poor scoring NMR ensembles are primarily inaccurate because they lack hydrogen bonds, rather than because they contain incorrect hydrogen bonds. We conclude that the accuracy of NMR structures will be improved by incorporation of HBRs but only if they are correct. This is important, because it implies that ANSURR scores will not improve on addition of incorrect HBRs. In the subsequent text, we therefore explore how to add HBRs, monitoring the accuracy of the resultant structures using ANSURR but also comparing to other measures. A plasmid for expression of mouse SH2 was constructed and inserted into Escherichia coli. The expressed protein is 118 residues long, with an 8-residue His-tag at the N-terminus, followed by the sequence D9QPLS \\u2026, with D9 corresponding to D519 of mature mouse SH2B. The protein was expressed and labeled uniformly with 15N and 13C. One aim of this project was to test out the automated assignment/structure calculation in FLYA/CYANA.17L\\u00f3pez-M\\u00e9ndez B. G\\u00fcntert P. Automated protein structure determination from NMR spectra.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 13112-13122Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar The NMR spectrum was therefore assigned automatically using CYANA, as well as manually. The NMR spectra used are listed in Table S2, and the final manually assigned HSQC is shown in Figure S2. A comparison of the two assignments showed that 99% of the automated backbone chemical shift assignments (1HN, 15N, 1H\\u03b1, 13C\\u03bf, 13C\\u03b1, and 13C\\u03b2) of SH2 (9\\u2013118) agreed with the manual assignment. The only resonances that were not assigned correctly by the automated calculation are the amide chemical shifts of Trp17 and Gln61, which are two of the four resonances that had missing signals (but assigned H and N) in the manual assignment. For aliphatic methyl and methylene sidechain groups, the agreement was 97%. On the other hand, many of the NOE-based chemical shift assignments did not match the manual assignment. This includes the amide sidechains of Arg, Asn, and Gln, and many aromatics: only 53% of these were assigned correctly (Figure S3). CYANA continues to check and refine its assignments throughout the structure calculations, and it is possible that some of these incorrect assignments would have been corrected. On the other hand, the accuracy of the automated structure calculation relies heavily on the accuracy of the first iteration, which in turn depends on the accuracy of the initial set of assignments.18G\\u00fcntert P.

Structure calculation was conducted using the standard automated routines within CYANA. We used the default CYANA calculation of 20 structures. We then repeated this calculation 60 times changing the random seed each time, in order to obtain a better \\u201cconsensus bundle\\u201d of structures,21Buchner L. G\\u00fcntert P. Increased reliability of nuclear magnetic resonance protein structures by consensus structure bundles.Structure. 2015; 23: 425-434https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2014.11.014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar giving a total of 1200 calculated structures per iteration. The reason for carrying out so many calculations was to generate a reliable set of HBRs, with good discrimination between correct and incorrect HBRs. The figure of 60 was determined by calculating the ratio of true positive HBRs (that is, HBRs identified that are also present in the crystal structure) to false positive HBRs (HBRs identified that are not in the crystal structure). This ratio improved with the number of calculations, reaching a plateau at 60 (Figure S4). HBRs were identified from these structures and used as restraints for the next iteration, as described below. The initial round of CYANA calculations produced an ensemble with a correct fold but low accuracy (as measured by ANSURR), and had poor convergence, a large RMSD between structures, and poor energies, all symptoms of a weak restraint set. We therefore improved the structures by iteratively and systematically including backbone hydrogen bond restraints, in such a way as to avoid incorrectly biasing the structure calculation (Figure 2). The protocol aims to generate HBRs that are present in a significant fraction of ensemble structures, supported by experimental temperature coefficients and/or amide exchange rates, and are consistent with other restraints. Iteration 6 was introduced as a way of removing any HBRs that were incompatible with the experimental restraints. The complete process identified 47 hydrogen bond restraints, mostly in regular secondary structure. The final set of HBRs is illustrated in Figure 3. Not surprisingly, the first HBRs to be identified came from the helices and from the \\u201ccore\\u201d \\u03b2-strands (residues 41\\u201369). The shorter \\u03b2-sheet HBRs tended to be added later. Many of the HBRs that do not form part of regular secondary structures (for example, HBRs from the amide protons of G14, Y15, G104, and V109) were identified in the final stages. More details are available in Table S3, which also shows that most of the HBRs that were added in an early iteration and subsequently removed are present in the crystal structure. At each stage in the calculation, the structures were analyzed to measure whether the additional HBRs were improving the quality of the ensemble. Our primary analytical tool was ANSURR. Figure 4 shows how ANSURR scores steadily increase as the number of HBRs increases, suggesting that inclusion of hydrogen bond restraints does improve accuracy. The best scoring models in the final iteration 6 approach the accuracy of AlphaFold222Jumper J. Evans R. Pritzel A. Green T. Figurnov M. Ronneberger O. Tunyasuvunakool K.

Note that the structures shown here come directly from CYANA and have not yet been refined in explicit solvent. The final iteration was designed to remove HBRs that do not have good supporting evidence. This iteration removed 4 out of 51 HBRs, leading to a drop in ANSURR score as well as some of the other measures of accuracy discussed below. The implication is that we probably removed correct HBRs, so this final step may have been over-cautious. Figures 4B\\u20134G depicts the ANSURR output for the best scoring model from each iteration. Figures 4H and 4I show ANSURR output for the X-ray structure (PDB: 5w3r) and the best scoring AlphaFold2 prediction, respectively.

It is of interest that the region for which NMR does worst is residues 46\\u201355, which is too flexible in the NMR structures but is better in the X-ray structure. In the crystal, there is a bound phosphate here. This is where phosphotyrosine binds. The residues in contact with the phosphate in the crystal structure (residues 47\\u201349) appear to be too rigid, suggesting that the phosphate is more tightly bound in the crystal than in solution, or perhaps that the flexibility according to chemical shifts represents an average of a bound state and unbound state. We have compared backbone chemical shifts for protein in 50 mM Tris buffer and in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6 (Figure S7). It is striking that almost all of the large chemical shift changes surround the location of the phosphate ion in the crystal structure, implying that phosphate binds here in 50 mM phosphate buffer. This may serve to rigidify the region, and explain why the NMR structure, which was determined in tris buffer, has low rigidity here. The previous section showed that inclusion of HBRs leads to a steady improvement in ANSURR score: i.e., a more accurate structure. Here, we report on other commonly used measures of quality, to characterize the structural improvement in more detail. The results are shown in Figure 5. The magnitude of NOE violations increases gradually as HBRs are included, although it remains low throughout (Figure 5A). The calculation of an NMR structure is a balance between forces pulling in different directions: for example, van der Waals violations push atoms apart, while NOE violations pull them together. For this reason, it is generally found that addition of a new type of restraint leads to a slight increase in violations of existing restraints.25Schwieters C.D. Bermejo G.A. Clore G.M. A three-dimensional potential of mean force to improve backbone and sidechain hydrogen bond geometry in Xplor-NIH protein structure determination.Protein Sci. 2020; 29: 100-110https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar We therefore do not see this result as surprising or indicative of structural errors. In a similar way, the magnitude of dihedral angle violations has a small but insignificant increase (Figure 5B), as do van der Waals violations (data not shown). The RMSD of backbone atoms to the crystal structure improves on initial addition of HBRs, up to iteration 4 after which there is little change (Figure 5C). This can be understood by the argument that HBRs are excellent for improving local geometry, but make little difference to the positions of backbone atoms. It is widely agreed that the template modeling score (TM-score) is a more accurate measure of global similarity than RMSD,26Zhang Y. Skolnick J. Scoring function for automated assessment of protein structure template quality.Proteins. 2004; 57: 702-710https://doi.org/10.1002/prot.20264Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar and we see a more clear trend for TM-score than for RMSD (Figure 5D). TM-score slightly increases up until iteration 4. Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) can be used either to validate the quality of NMR structures or as restraints to improve NMR structures, but not both at the same time (unless steps are taken to separate them into different groups).27Chiliveri S.C. Robertson A.J. Shen Y. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Advances in NMR spectroscopy of weakly aligned biomolecular systems.Chem.

The chemical shifts of amide proteins should be a sensitive measure of structural accuracy, because they are strongly affected by hydrogen bonding.29Asakura T. Taoka K. Demura M. Williamson M.P.

NMR. 2011; 50: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar and compared them to the experimental shifts (Figure 5F), which improve steadily as HBRs are added. The distribution of Ramachandran angles also improves slightly up to iteration 4 (Figure 5G). Finally, we have calculated the backbone ensemble RMSD (Figure 5H). This is a measure of precision rather than accuracy, but our survey of PDB structures indicated that it does correlate with accuracy, presumably because adding more (correct) restraints serves to improve both accuracy and precision at the same time2Fowler N.J. Sljoka A. Williamson M.P. The accuracy of NMR protein structures in the Protein Data Bank.Structure. 2021; 29: 1430-1439.e2https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2021.07.001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar; and indeed, RMSD decreases steadily as HBRs are added. Thus in summary, the gradual addition of 47 HBRs results in an improvement in accuracy, as measured by a wide range of parameters, with the improvement in accuracy slowing down as the number of HBRs increases. These metrics clearly show that there is overall no increased penalty to the structure quality from their inclusion: in other words, the HBRs are correct and do not conflict with the other structural restraints. The accuracy clearly improves until iteration 4. Iteration 5 results in an improvement on some measures but a deterioration in others, while iteration 6 (in which some HBRs were removed for lack of good evidence) represents a deterioration in almost all measures, the exception being precision (Figure 5H). It is well established that refinement in solvent is required in order to produce good quality structures.1Fowler N.J. Sljoka A. Williamson M.P.

Recent publications, including our own, have demonstrated a role for this enzyme in other chronic inflammatory diseases, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, to date there has been no studies looking into the role of BACE1 in the autoimmune condition Systemic Sclerosis (SSc). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of BACE1 in SSc tissue fibrosis. Methods Patient fibroblasts were obtained from full thickness forearm skin biopsies from healthy and early diffuse SSc patients. BACE1 was inhibited with the small molecule inhibitors M-3 and AZD3839 and siRNA specific to BACE1. Morphogen signalling was activated with recombinant TGF-\\u03b2, Wnt-3a or the smoothened agonist SAG. Xenotransplant mouse model using patient pDC was used to interrogate in vivo expression of BACE1 in fibrosis. Results Here we show that BACE1 protein levels are elevated in SSc patient skin biopsies, as well as dermal fibroblasts and in mouse skin during fibrosis. Inhibition of BACE1 with small molecule inhibitors or siRNA blocked SSc and morphogen mediated fibroblast pro-fibrotic activation. Furthermore, we show that BACE1 regulation of dermal fibroblast activation is dependent on the \\u03b2-catenin and Notch signalling pathway activation.

Gene editing demonstrated that pfaat1 S258 L potentiates CQ-resistance but at a cost of reduced fitness, while pfaat1 F313 S , a common Southeast Asian polymorphism, reduces CQ-resistance while restoring fitness. Our analyses reveal hidden complexity in CQ-resistance evolution, suggesting that pfaat1 may underlie regional differences in the dynamics of resistance evolution, and modulate parasite resistance or fitness by manipulating the balance between both amino acid and drug transport.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.26.493611\", \"publication_date\": \"2022-05-26\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4386419407\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1002/fes3.498\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"Reviving grain quality in wheat through non\\u2010destructive phenotyping techniques like hyperspectral imaging\", \"abstract\": \"Abstract A long\\u2010term goal of breeders and researchers is to develop crop varieties that can resist environmental stressors and produce high yields.

Current gold-standard pharmacological treatments only provide symptomatic relief, meaning that surgical replacement of failing hearts (through transplant) remains the sole curative intervention.1 In the past decade, hopes were raised that therapies using (adeno and adeno-associated [AAV]) viral vectors\\u2014targeting aberrant cellular genetic programs, would restore a normal cardiac phenotype by modulating the expression of crucial proteins.2 The 2 sets of human clinical trials which attempted these gene therapies, sought to modulate the expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase3and adenyl cyclase 6.4 These proteins are crucial components of cardiomyocyte excitation-contraction coupling machinery modulating the abbreviation of cellular calcium-induced calcium release and the phosphorylation/activation of calcium-handling proteins, respectively. In the aftermath of these trials which had neutral results, researchers began to question whether directly targeting excitation-contraction coupling was the correct approach. The pathological remodeling of the myocardium during heart failure is driven by the activation of a fetal gene program. This hypertrophic program modulates a panel of genes causing significant changes to cardiomyocyte structure, which are initially compensatory, but deleterious in the medium to long-term. Thus, targeting the transcriptional machinery which controls hypertrophic signaling, has been suggested as an alternative approach for therapies.5Article, see p 1306In this issue, Wang et al6 describe an approach that may bridge the two approaches through the singular behavior of the structural protein JPH-2 (junctophillin 2).The plasma membrane of the adult cardiomyocyte is penetrated at regular intervals by tubular elements, which form part of a wider transverse-axial tubular system. The transverse-axial tubular system permits the transduction of ion currents rapidly and synchronously throughout the cardiomyocyte, where diffusion will not suffice. L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) modulate calcium-induced calcium release at junctional membrane complexes within the transverse-axial tubular system. JPH-2, a scaffolding protein, recruits functional LTCCs to the junctional membrane complexes, associating them with the ryanodine receptors which drive the release of calcium ions through calcium-induced calcium release.7 JPH-2 supports the structural integrity of the transverse-axial tubular system through a cholesterol dependent mechanism and interaction with the cytoskeleton through microtubules.8,9 Alongside, these crucial functions JPH-2 was discovered to have, potentially salutary, transcription factor activity.10 In situations of cellular stress JPH-2 can be cleaved by calpain-1. This process yields an N-terminal peptide (JPH-2NT) which can move to the nucleus and bind to TATA-box elements which has the effect of repressing the prohypertrophic gene program induced by cardiac pathology. This unusual, multifaceted behavior provides an important homeostatic mechanism linking the structures which control excitation-contraction coupling and the processes which govern the induction of prohypertrophic signaling.10Wang et al6 have demonstrated that mice overexpressing JPH-2NT have a significantly milder cardiac phenotype following the induction of cardiac hypertrophy following transverse aortic constriction (TAC). The hearts of mice overexpressing JPH-2NT display much less fibrosis and a preserved cellular TAT network. An investigation of the genetic changes induced by JPH-2NT suggests that this is, in part, due to the reversal of deleterious prohypertrophic signaling programs. Overexpression of JPH-2NT is a promising strategy for cardiac gene therapy as it retains the useful properties of earlier gene therapy approaches (maintaining inotropy and preserving cellular ultrastructure) but also offers the broadband reversal of hypertrophic signaling.Neonatal mice were infected with AAV (2/9) vectors expressing JPH-2NT or a mutant peptide incapable of binding DNA (\\u0394bNLS/ARR). After 9 weeks, the mice were subjected to transaortic constriction to induce cardiac stress and failure due to hypertrophy. After 5 weeks of TAC, mice that received the bona fide JPH-2NT retained a significant degree of cardiac functionality, exhibited far less cardiac remodeling and fibrosis in comparison to mice that received eGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) or \\u0394bNLS/ARR. None of the vectors induced aberrant effects in the SHAM control animals. The positive functional effects of JPH-2NT overexpression in TAC animals appeared to correlate with changes in the cardiomyocytes at the ultrastructural level. TAT regularity was preserved in mice that received JPH-2NT. Importantly, the presence of AAV was confirmed in cardiomyocytes infected by the 3 vectors. Only cells infected with AAV-expressing JPH-2NT had preserved TAT integrity (at levels similar to SHAM animals). The phenotype of mice subjected to TAC continued to worsen past 8 weeks in animals infected with AAV-eGFP but animals which received AAV-JPH-2NT escaped the phenotype. An RNA-Seq investigation demonstrated that JPH-2NT infection prevented the induction of hypertrophic and heart failure related gene programs.As discussed, human clinical trials of cardiac gene therapy have so far only targeted 2 genes, with indifferent results. A significant number of other preclinical trials (in mice and large animal species) have shown efficacy of a gene targeting approach, across different phenotypes, but failed to make the transition to human trials.2 Numerous potential reasons for the inability of human trials to meet their primary goals have been posited, including issues with the vector, gene, delivery, human heterogeneity, and the designs of studies themselves. The purview of this study was to investigate a better genetic target. A lack of beneficial effect of protein overexpression or immunogenicity have been speculated to be the reasons for nonefficacy stemming from the target selection. In this instance, JPH-2NT undoubtedly has efficacy in this preclinical model and there were no indications of adverse immune effects. JPH-2NT based therapy offers the potential benefits indicated by early investigations of gene therapy with sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase in preclinical models. These include the restoration of cardiac function and the maintenance of normal cardiomyocyte ultrastructure.11 As a therapeutic strategy JPH-2NT also offers a broadband modification of the induction of prohypertrophic transcription. Numerous transcriptional regulator targets, such as BRD4, CDK8/9, and HDAC, have been identified for pharmacological therapies but targeting these processes with genetic manipulation offers a more sustainable approach.5This study prepares mice by infecting them with AAV before inducing cardiac damage. Therefore, the phenomena that the article presents is the escape from the cardiac phenotype induced by TAC after JPH-2NT delivery. Clearly, this approach is not currently viable (or perhaps even desirable) in human patients. Therefore, the focus of further studies should be to evaluate whether JPH-2NT application to wild-type mice with preexisting heart failure, has a therapeutic effect. One important finding of the study relates the choice of vector. AAV2 remains the only rationally designed AAV-vector with excellent tropism and transduction efficiency for cardiomyocytes. The liver tropism which seems to ruin the efficacy of other vectors is not apparent in this study.12 A significant amount of the viral vector seems to collect in the skeletal muscle of infected animals. JPH-2 performs extensive functions within skeletal muscle (another type of striated muscle) which are extremely similar to those performed in cardiac muscle.13 The significance of the overexpression of JPH-2 in skeletal muscle induced by this vector should, therefore, be explored. Unlike, cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle hypertrophy seems to invariably associate with improved health outcomes, especially in senescent patients. But the specific effect of JPH-2NT on skeletal muscle hypertrophy is unclear.14 Finally, it must be mentioned that the potential utility of the JPH-2 molecule, with respect to transcription factor manipulation, is not limited to the N terminus, given that a fragment of the C terminus has also been demonstrated to have transcriptional activity.15In summary, promoting beneficial anti-hypertrophic signaling and the preservation of cell structure by overexpressing the JPH-2NT fragment is a promising avenue for cardiac therapy. Targeting JPH-2 related mechanisms recapitulates the useful effects of past gene therapy approaches linking maintenance of excitation-contraction-coupling with a novel broader effect on prohypertrophic gene programs.Article InformationSources of FundingThis work was supported by British Heart Foundation Grant (RG/17/13/33173 to Dr Gorelik).Disclosures None.FootnotesThe opinions expressed in this article are not necessarily those of the editors or of the American Heart Association.For Sources of Funding and Disclosures, see page 1319 & 1320.Correspondence to: Julia Gorelik, PhD, Cardiac Section, National Heart, and Lung Institute (NHLI), Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Campus, Du Cane Rd, London W12 0NN, United Kingdom.

Although genomewide association studies (GWAS) have advanced our understanding of the disease, the precise manner in which risk polymorphisms contribute to disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Of relevance, GWAS have shown that a polymorphism (rs12608932) in the UNC13A gene is associated with risk for both ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Homozygosity for the C-allele at rs12608932 modifies the ALS phenotype, as these patients are more likely to have bulbar-onset disease, cognitive impairment and FTD at baseline as well as shorter survival. UNC13A is expressed in neuronal tissue and is involved in maintaining synaptic active zones, by enabling the priming and docking of synaptic vesicles. In the absence of functional TDP-43, risk variants in UNC13A lead to the inclusion of a cryptic exon in UNC13A messenger RNA, subsequently leading to nonsense mediated decay, with loss of functional protein. Depletion of UNC13A leads to impaired neurotransmission. Recent discoveries have identified UNC13A as a potential target for therapy development in ALS, with a confirmatory trial with lithium carbonate in UNC13A cases now underway and future approaches with antisense oligonucleotides currently under consideration. Considering UNC13A is a potent phenotypic modifier, it may also impact clinical trial outcomes. This present review describes the path from the initial discovery of UNC13A as a risk gene in ALS to the current therapeutic options being explored and how knowledge of its distinct phenotype needs to be taken into account in future trials.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2022-330504\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-02-03\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4310142617\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1093/plcell/koac340\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"The small peptide CEP1 and the NIN-like protein NLP1 regulate <i>NRT2.1</i> to mediate root nodule formation across nitrate concentrations\", \"abstract\": \"Legumes acquire fixed nitrogen (N) from the soil and through endosymbiotic association with diazotrophic bacteria.

The NIN-like protein (NLP) MtNLP1 is required for MtNRT2.1 expression and regulation of nitrate uptake/transport under low- and high-nitrate conditions. Under low nitrate, the gene encoding the C-terminally encoded peptide (CEP) MtCEP1 was more highly expressed, and the exogenous application of MtCEP1 systemically promoted MtNRT2.1 expression in a compact root architecture 2 (MtCRA2)-dependent manner. The enhancement of nodulation by MtCEP1 and nitrate uptake were both impaired in the Mtnrt2.1 mutant under low nitrate.

HSV-1 pUL21 is a virus-encoded protein phosphatase adaptor that promotes dephosphorylation of multiple cellular and virus proteins, including the cellular ceramide (Cer) transport protein CERT. CERT mediates nonvesicular Cer transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the trans-Golgi network, whereupon Cer is converted to sphingomyelin (SM) and other sphingolipids that play important roles in cellular proliferation, signaling, and membrane trafficking. Here, we use click chemistry to profile the kinetics of sphingolipid metabolism, showing that pUL21-mediated dephosphorylation activates CERT and accelerates Cer-to-SM conversion. Purified pUL21 and full-length CERT interact with submicromolar affinity, and we solve the solution structure of the pUL21 C-terminal domain in complex with the CERT Pleckstrin homology and steroidogenic acute regulatory-related lipid transfer domains using small-angle X-ray scattering. We identify a single amino acid mutation on the surface of pUL21 that disrupts CERT binding in vitro and in cultured cells. This residue is highly conserved across the genus Simplexvirus. In addition, we identify a pUL21 residue essential for binding to HSV-1 pUL16. Sphingolipid profiling demonstrates that Cer-to-SM conversion is severely diminished in the context of HSV-1 infection, a defect that is compounded when infecting with a virus encoding the mutated form of pUL21 that lacks the ability to activate CERT. However, virus replication and spread in cultured keratinocytes or epithelial cells is not significantly altered when pUL21-mediated CERT dephosphorylation is abolished.

We proceeded to further characterize the mutations and clinical disease severity of these two sub-lineages. Methods 705 delta SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced by our laboratory from mid-May to November 2021 using Illumina and Oxford Nanopore were included in the analysis. The clinical disease severity of 440/705 individuals were further analyzed to determine if infection with either AY.28 or AY.104 was associated with more severe disease. Sub-genomic RNA (sg-RNA) expression was analyzed using periscope. Results AY.28 was the dominant variant throughout the outbreak, accounting for 67.7% of infections during the peak of the outbreak. AY.28 had three lineage defining mutations in the spike protein: A222V (92.80%), A701S (88.06%), and A1078S (92.04%) and seven in the ORF1a: R24C, K634N, P1640L, A2994V, A3209V, V3718A, and T3750I. AY.104 was characterized by the high prevalence of T95I (90.81%) and T572L (65.01%) mutations in the spike protein and by the absence of P1640L (94.28%) in ORF1a with the presence of A1918V (98.58%) mutation. The mean sgRNA expression levels of ORF6 in AY.28 were significantly higher compared to AY.104 ( p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and B.1.617.2 ( p &amp;lt; 0.01). Also, ORF3a showed significantly higher sgRNA expression in AY.28 compared to AY.104 ( p &amp;lt; 0.0001). There was no difference in the clinical disease severity or duration of hospitalization in individuals infected with these sub lineages. Conclusions Therefore, AY.28 and AY.104 appear to have a fitness advantage over the parental delta variant (B.1.617.2), while AY.28 also had a higher expression of sg-RNA compared to other sub-lineages.

To systematically characterize the proteome of contact sites and support the discovery of new tethers and functional molecules, we established a high throughput screening approach in Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on co-localization imaging. We imaged split fluorescence reporters for six different contact sites, two of which have never been studied before, on the background of 1165 strains expressing a mCherry-tagged yeast protein that have a cellular punctate distribution (a hallmark of contact sites). By scoring both co-localization events and effects on reporter size and abundance, we discovered over 100 new potential contact site residents and effectors in yeast. Focusing on several of the newly identified residents, we identified one set of hits as previously unrecognized homologs to Vps13 and Atg2.

Here, we investigate 100 LRRK2 variants linked to PD, including previously described pathogenic mutations. We identify 23 LRRK2 variants that robustly stimulate kinase activity, including variants within the N-terminal non-catalytic regions [ARM (E334K, A419V), ANK(R767H), LRR (R1067Q, R1325Q)], as well as variants predicted to destabilise the ROC:COR B interface [ROC (A1442P, V1447M), COR A (R1628P) COR B (S1761R, L1795F)] and COR:COR dimer interface [COR B (R1728H/L)].

Both incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity are thought to be caused by a range of factors, including common variants, variants in regulatory regions, epigenetics, environmental factors, and lifestyle. Many thousands of genetic variants have been identified as the cause of monogenic disorders, mostly determined through small clinical studies, and thus, the penetrance and expressivity of these variants may be overestimated when compared to their effect on the general population. With the wealth of population cohort data currently available, the penetrance and expressivity of such genetic variants can be investigated across a much wider contingent, potentially helping to reclassify variants that were previously thought to be completely penetrant. Research into the penetrance and expressivity of such genetic variants is important for clinical classification, both for determining causative mechanisms of disease in the affected population and for providing accurate risk information through genetic counseling. A genotype-based definition of the causes of rare diseases incorporating information from population cohorts and clinical studies is critical for our understanding of incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. This review examines our current knowledge of the penetrance and expressivity of genetic variants in rare disease and across populations, as well as looking into the potential causes of the variation seen, including genetic modifiers, mosaicism, and polygenic factors, among others.

Studying the microbial communities from flowback fluids that are assumed to inhabit these environments provides insights into their ecophysiology, and in particular their ability to survive in these extreme environments as well as their influence on site operation e.g. via problematic biofouling processes and/or biocorrosion. Over the past decade, research on fractured shale microbiology has focused on wells in North America, with a few additional reported studies conducted in China. To extend the knowledge in this area, we characterized the geochemistry and microbial ecology of two exploratory shale gas wells in the Bowland Shale, UK. We then employed a meta-analysis approach to compare geochemical and 16S rRNA gene sequencing data from our study site with previously published research from geographically distinct formations spanning China, Canada and the USA. Results Our findings revealed that fluids recovered from exploratory wells in the Bowland are characterized by moderate salinity and high microbial diversity. The microbial community was dominated by lineages known to degrade hydrocarbons, including members of Shewanellaceae , Marinobacteraceae, Halomonadaceae and Pseudomonadaceae . Moreover, UK fractured shale communities lacked the usually dominant Halanaerobium lineages. From our meta-analysis, we infer that chloride concentrations play a dominant role in controlling microbial community composition. Spatio-temporal trends were also apparent, with different shale formations giving rise to communities of distinct diversity and composition. Conclusions These findings highlight an unexpected level of compositional heterogeneity across fractured shale formations, which is not only relevant to inform management practices but also provides insight into the ability of diverse microbial consortia to tolerate the extreme conditions characteristic of the engineered deep subsurface.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40793-023-00465-1\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-02-28\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4289861446\", \"doi_x\": \"10.15252/embj.2022112181\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"<scp>ARFs</scp> get the <scp>BioID</scp> treatment: what have we been missing?\", \"abstract\": \"Li et al present the results of a proximity\\u2010interaction screen in mammalian cells for the effector proteins of 25 members of the Arf family of small GTPases.

The age at onset was 67 years. The disease course was slowly progressive, he experienced a good response to dopaminergic therapy, and dementia was absent. Family history was suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance, with the father and two brothers also diagnosed with PD. However, the father was already deceased, one brother was not available for examination, and the second brother died early after giving blood for genetic investigation. Both brothers carried a new p.F1700L (NM_198578.4: c.5098T>C) variant in LRRK2, initially detected by gene panel analysis in the deceased brother and further investigated by Sanger sequencing. The variant is rated as a variant of uncertain significance according to the criteria of the American College of Medical Genetics (assessed by Franklin: https://franklin.genoox.com/) and is not listed in gnomAD (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/). In silico prediction suggested pathogenicity based on a Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) score (https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/) of 27.3. The variant is located within the C terminus of the Ras of complex protein B scaffolding domain.5 We investigated LRRK2 kinase pathway activity in a heterologous transient overexpression system in HEK293 cells as described previously5 (Fig. 1A). We then analyzed LRRK2 activity in vivo in fresh peripheral blood, simultaneously collected from a p.F1700L carrier and a sex-matched healthy control subject (Fig. 1B). The resulting LRRK2-dependent pRab10Thr73 phosphorylation level mirrors LRRK2 kinase activation status.6 Both experiments demonstrated significant LRRK2 kinase hyperactivation because of the p.F1700L variant. Notably, p.F1700L demonstrated LRRK2 kinase hyperactivation similar to the neighboring p.Y1699C variant, which has the highest degree of kinase activity among all LRRK2 variants investigated thus far in the HEK293 assay (Fig. 1A). Moreover, we found a 7- to 8-fold increase in Rab10 phosphorylation levels in vivo (Fig. 1B). Together, we provide robust evidence for the pathogenicity of the newly identified p.F1700L variant in LRRK2, demonstrating that this substitution is among the variants with the highest kinase activity of all LRRK2 variants investigated to date and impacts protein function more profoundly than, for example, the frequent p.G2019S variant.5, 6 Thus, carriers of a p.F1700L variant should be included in clinical trials targeting LRRK2 kinase activity already initiated or soon commencing.4 Finally, we confirmed the applicability and usefulness of the applied assays to determine the pathogenicity of LRRK2 variants of uncertain significance.

Here we demonstrate substantial evasion of neutralization by Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants in vitro using sera from individuals vaccinated with ChAdOx1, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273. These data were mirrored by a substantial reduction in real-world vaccine effectiveness that was partially restored by booster vaccination.

We have combined synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering and high-resolution microscopy to provide insights into the nanoscale structure of BK-DNA complexes, unveiling the formation of ordered nanofibrils. Fluorescence assays hint that BK is more efficient at displacing minor-groove binders in comparison with base-intercalant dyes, thus, suggesting that interaction with DNA strands is mediated by electrostatic attraction between cationic groups at BK and the high negative electron density of minor-grooves. Our data also revealed an intriguing finding that BK-DNA complexes can induce a limited uptake of nucleotides by HEK-293t cells, which is a feature that has not been previously reported for BK. Moreover, we observed that the complexes retained the native bioactivity of BK, including the ability to modulate Ca2+ response into endothelial HUVEC cells.

Detection leads to DNA loading of the Cas3 helicase-nuclease, leading to long-range deletions in the targeted DNA, thus providing immunity against mobile genetic elements (MGE). Here, we focus on the type I-G system, a streamlined, 4-subunit complex with an atypical Cas3 enzyme. We demonstrate that Cas3 helicase activity is not essential for immunity against MGE in vivo and explore applications of the Thioalkalivibrio sulfidiphilus Cascade effector for genome engineering in Escherichia coli . Long-range, bidirectional deletions were observed when the lacZ gene was targeted. Deactivation of the Cas3 helicase activity dramatically altered the types of deletions observed, with small deletions flanked by direct repeats that are suggestive of microhomology mediated end joining. When donor DNA templates were present, both the wild-type and helicase-deficient systems promoted homology-directed repair (HDR), with the latter system providing improvements in editing efficiency, suggesting that a single nick in the target site may promote HDR in E. coli using the type I-G system.

Phylogenetic evidence suggests that it was tightly linked to eukaryogenesis, which involved an unprecedented rise in both genome size and the density of genetic repeats. Expansion of genome size raised the severity of Muller's ratchet, while limiting the effectiveness of lateral gene transfer (LGT) at purging deleterious mutations. In principle, an increase in recombination length combined with higher rates of LGT could solve this problem. Here, we show using a computational model that this solution fails in the presence of genetic repeats prevalent in early eukaryotes. The model demonstrates that dispersed repeat sequences allow ectopic recombination, which leads to the loss of genetic information and curtails the capacity of LGT to prevent mutation accumulation. Increasing recombination length in the presence of repeat sequences exacerbates the problem. Mutational decay can only be resisted with homology along extended sequences of DNA.

A broadly applicable feature of GPCRs following agonist occupancy is that phosphorylation of various hydroxy-amino acids within intracellular sequences of the receptor is stimulated and this promotes the effectiveness of interactions of the receptor with arrestin isoforms (12Wanka L.

These can then potentially be used as surrogate reagents to detect and demonstrate the extent of receptor activation in situ. Among ligands that activate GPR84, the recently described molecule 3-(2-((4-chloronaphthalen-1-yl)oxy)ethyl)pyridine 1-oxide (DL-175) is reported to be functionally \\u201cbiased,\\u201d in that, although a potent regulator of G protein\\u2013mediated signaling, it is not effective in promoting arrestin interactions (21Lucy D.

Because we anticipated that DL-175 and 6-OAU might well produce a different pattern or extent of phosphorylation of GPR84, to obtain a fuller understanding of such potential variation caused by GPR84 activators, herein in addition we have assessed both 2-(hexylthio)pyrimidine-4,6 diol (2-HTP) as a potent orthosteric activator (7Mancini S.J.

Identification of surrogate ligands for orphan G protein-coupled receptors.Life Sci. 2003; 74: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We show that, although both 2-HTP and 6-OAU produce effective phosphorylation of human GPR84 at residues within the third intracellular loop, neither DL-175 nor PSB-16771 does so. Moreover, although each of 2-HTP, 6-OAU, and DL-175 acts as orthosteric agonists of GPR84, we use homology modeling and mutagenesis to provide a molecular basis for their differences in function and bias. In addition, based on mass spectrometry, we identify residues in the third intracellular loop of GPR84 that are phosphorylated constitutively. Production of antisera that identify specific sites of both constitutive and agonist-regulated phosphorylation allowed us to demonstrate that phosphorylation at amino acids Thr263 and/or Thr264 is required to generate highly effective interactions with arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 and that these amino acids become phosphorylated in a GRK2/3-dependent manner. By contrast, neither Ser221 nor Ser224, which are constitutively phosphorylated and not affected by inhibition of GRK2/3, plays a major role in arrestin-2 or arrestin-3-interactions. However, the phosphorylation status of neither of these sets of amino acids impacts on the ability of the receptor to regulate cellular levels of cAMP. Of importance, as GPR84 is markedly upregulated in a wide range of immune cells and in a variety of proinflammatory settings (4Wang J. Wu X. Simonavicius N. Tian H. Ling L.

In addition, we selected DL-175, a compound optimized following a virtual screen and reported to display marked G protein signaling compared with arrestin-interaction bias at GPR84 (21Lucy D.

To initiate studies, we expressed stably in Flp-In TREx 293 cells human GPR84 with enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein linked in-frame to the intracellular C-terminal tail of the receptor (hGPR84-eYFP) (24Mahmud Z.A.

In membranes prepared from such doxycycline-induced cells the ability of each ligand to cause activation of Gi-G proteins was measured via [35S]GTP\\u03b3S binding assays. Each compound promoted an increase in binding of [35S]GTP\\u03b3S in a concentration-dependent fashion with rank order 2-HTP > PSB-16671 > 6-OAU = DL-175 (Fig. 1B), and each ligand displayed similar efficacy at maximally effective concentrations (Fig. 1B). Activation of GPR84 with certain, but not all, ligands is reported to promote interaction with arrestin isoforms (21Lucy D. Purvis G.S.D. Zeboudj L. Chatzopoulou M. Recio C. Bataille C.J.R.

When hGPR84-eYFP was transiently coexpressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells with arrestin-3 fused to nanoluciferase, 2-HTP effectively promoted proximity and potential interactions between the receptor and this arrestin construct (Fig. 1C). 6-OAU was also able to promote interactions between hGPR84-eYFP and arrestin-3-nanoluciferase. Once more 2-HTP was substantially more potent than 6-OAU, although it was not possible to add 6-OAU at sufficiently high concentrations to allow full concentration\\u2013response curves to be defined (Fig. 1C) because both compounds displayed substantially lower potency than in the [35S]GTP\\u03b3S binding studies (compare Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast, DL-175 did not promote measurable interactions between hGPR84-eYFP and arrestin-3-nanoluciferase at any concentration that was practical to assess (Fig. 1C) and neither did PSB-16671 (Fig. 1C). However, as anticipated for a positive allosteric modulator at GPR84 (7Mancini S.J. Mahmud Z.A. Jenkins L. Bolognini D. Newman R. Barnes M. Edye M.E. McMahon S.B. Tobin A.B. Milligan G.

Chem. 2017; 60: 3636-3655Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) PSB-16671 substantially increased (p < 0.0001) the potency of 2-HTP in such arrestin-3 interaction studies (Fig. 1D), and this was also the case for 6-OAU (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1E). By contrast, coaddition of DL-175 did not increase the observed potency of 2-HTP (Fig. 1D) or 6-OAU (Fig. 1E). Interaction of a GPCR with an arrestin is often dependent upon phosphorylation of the receptor that occurs subsequent to agonist occupancy of the receptor (12Wanka L. Behr V. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Arrestin-dependent internalization of rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors.Biol. Chem. 2021; 403: 133-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To examine this directly we labeled Flp-In TREx 293 cells induced to express hGPR84-eYFP with [32P] orthophosphate and then treated the cells with vehicle or a concentration of 2-HTP (3.7 \\u00d7 10-6 M) determined to produce an EC90 effect in the arrestin-3 interaction BRET assay. Lysates of these cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) antiserum (that also identifies eYFP) and then resolved by SDS-PAGE. After drying, such gels were subsequently exposed to X-ray film. No substantial incorporation of [32P] was detected in vehicle-treated samples. However, clear incorporation of [32P] into polypeptide(s) with molecular mass corresponding to some 80 kDa was observed following treatment with 2-HTP, with close to maximal incorporation of [32P] achieved within 5 min of agonist exposure (Fig. 2A). 6-OAU (6.4 \\u00d7 10\\u22125 M) also effectively promoted incorporation of [32P] into hGPR84-eYFP (Fig. 2B). Because neither DL-175 nor PSB-16671 produced effective interactions of hGPR84-eYFP with arrestin-3, and therefore no EC90 concentration could be defined, for [32P]-phosphorylation studies we employed concentrations of these ligands that were 100 times greater than their EC90 concentrations in [35S]GTP\\u03b3S binding studies on the basis that, as shown earlier, 2-HTP and 6-OAU were to this extent less potent in the arrestin-3 interaction studies than in [35S]GTP\\u03b3S binding studies. However, even at these concentrations, no significant incorporation of [32P] into hGPR84-eYFP was observed in samples treated with either DL-175 (9.8 \\u00d7 10\\u22125 M) or PSB-16671 (1.3 \\u00d7 10\\u22125 M) (Fig. 2B). As expected, the ability of 2-HTP to promote phosphorylation of hGPR84-eYFP was prevented by coincubation with either of two chemically distinct GPR84 antagonists, GLPG1205 (8Lab\\u00e9gu\\u00e8re F.

Vaccinated people with severe obesity (BMI&gt;40 kg/m 2 ) were significantly more likely to experience hospitalization or death from Covid-19. Excess risk increased with time since vaccination. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we conducted a prospective longitudinal study of the immune response in a clinical cohort of vaccinated people with severe obesity. Compared with normal weight people, six months after their second vaccine dose, significantly more people with severe obesity had unquantifiable titres of neutralizing antibody against authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus, reduced frequencies of antigen-experienced SARS-CoV-2 Spike-binding B cells, and a dissociation between anti-Spike antibody levels and neutralizing capacity.

Large-scale genome-sequencing efforts have provided close to real-time tracking of the global spread and diversification of SARS-CoV-2 since its entry into the human population in late 2019. These data have underpinned analysis of its origins, epidemiology, and adaptations to the human population: principally immune evasion and increasing transmissibility. SARS-CoV-2, despite being a new human pathogen, was highly capable of human-to-human transmission. During its rapid spread in humans, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved independent new forms, the so-called \\\"variants of concern,\\\" that are better optimized for human-to-human transmission. The most important adaptation of the bat coronavirus progenitor of both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 for human infection (and other mammals) is the use of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Relaxed structural constraints provide plasticity to SARS-related coronavirus spike protein permitting it to accommodate significant amino acid replacements of antigenic consequence without compromising the ability to bind to ACE2. Although the bulk of research has justifiably concentrated on the viral spike protein as the main determinant of antigenic evolution and changes in transmissibility, there is accumulating evidence for the contribution of other regions of the viral proteome to virus-host interaction. Whereas levels of community transmission of recombinants compromising genetically distinct variants are at present low, when divergent variants cocirculate, recombination between SARS-CoV-2 clades is being detected, increasing the risk that viruses with new properties emerge. Applying computational and machine learning methods to genome sequence data sets to generate experimentally verifiable predictions will serve as an early warning system for novel variant surveillance and will be important in future vaccine planning. Omicron, the latest SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, has focused attention on step change antigenic events, \\\"shift,\\\" as opposed to incremental \\\"drift\\\" changes in antigenicity. Both an increase in transmissibility and antigenic shift in Omicron led to it readily causing infections in the fully vaccinated and/or previously infected. Omicron's virulence, while reduced relative to the variant of concern it replaced, Delta, is very much premised on the past immune exposure of individuals with a clear signal that boosted vaccination protects from severe disease. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 has proven itself to be a dangerous new human respiratory pathogen with an unpredictable evolutionary capacity, leading to a risk of future variants too great not to ensure all regions of the world are screened by viral genome sequencing, protected through available and affordable vaccines, and have non-punitive strategies in place for detecting and responding to novel variants of concern.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1101/cshperspect.a041390\", \"publication_date\": \"2022-04-20\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4283260526\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1038/s41598-022-14411-7\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"Transmission of B.1.617.2 Delta variant between vaccinated healthcare workers\", \"abstract\": \"Abstract Breakthrough infections with SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant have been reported in doubly-vaccinated recipients and as re-infections.

Mechanistic similarities between NSP2 and the unrelated bacterial RNA chaperone Hfq suggest that accelerating RNA dissociation while promoting intermolecular RNA interactions may be a widespread strategy of RNA chaperone recycling.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2100198118\", \"publication_date\": \"2021-10-06\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4308433996\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1080/21541248.2022.2131313\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"Small-molecule inhibitors of P-Rex guanine-nucleotide exchange factors\", \"abstract\": \"P-Rex1 and P-Rex2 are guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that activate Rac small GTPases in response to the stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.

Introduction\\u2018So, Nat'ralists observe, a FleaHath smaller Fleas that on him prey,And these have smaller yet to bite 'em,And so proceed ad infinitum\\u2019\\u223c Jonathan Swift (1733; see http://www.online-literature.com/swift/3515/) Early microscopists, training their lenses on samples, observed individual microbes, separated from one another by membranes and cell walls and dividing by binary fission. These observations developed into an understanding of microbial diversity and ecology that, by and large, placed cellular organisms at the centre. How would our perspective of microbiology be different, had those seventeenth century glass grinders invented the genome sequencer instead? A quarter century of using genomics to examine microbial genomes has illuminated a world rife with mobile genetic elements (MGEs): entities that have evolved to persist and replicate through adaptations that move DNA. The roll call of MGEs is long, diverse and growing [1]. Some MGEs, like transposons and insertion sequences, move DNA between locations within a cell. Others, like conjugative elements and bacteriophages, move DNA between cells. Many MGEs are mosaic or modular in their structure, enabling coalitions of different functions and defying straightforward classification [2]. Regardless, it is clear that MGEs can be both powerful and elusive. Unlike the microbes that carry them, it is difficult to meaningfully visualize an MGE, since in most cases, MGEs are essentially strands of DNA, nested within genomes. But as the principal cause of horizontal gene transfer (HGT)\\u2014a major mode of microbial evolution in which individual microbes get genetic information from sources other than their parents [3]\\u2014MGEs have a huge impact on adaptation and genome structure [4]. Though we have known about MGEs for a long time [5], it is only in recent years, with the explosion of relatively inexpensive sequencing, that we have begun to understand their unique contribution to microbial evolution.The effective invisibility of MGEs has meant that they have often been conceptualized as traits or properties of their microbial hosts. Many MGEs indeed replicate along with their host cells, and can provide benefits that improve host fitness. But MGEs also have an alternative route to success, because the DNA moved by MGEs often encodes the MGE itself, providing an alternative opportunity for MGE replication that is not necessarily shared with other genes in a cell. As a consequence, these autonomous MGEs experience selection occurring at multiple levels [6]. The resulting pressures may not align with those acting on other regions of the genome, and can instead favour adaptations that can generate intragenomic conflicts [7]. For example, traits that promote selfish MGE transmission to other cells can impose a burden on the current host [8,9]. The evolutionary prospects of an autonomous MGE are thus not confined by the borders of the cell, and instead incorporate transmission across hosts and genetic backgrounds.One defining feature of living things is their ability to evolve adaptations to enhance reproductive success and fitness. While not alive in any conventional sense, MGEs, with their own interests and adaptive trajectories transcending those of their hosts, might well be considered to have \\u2018lives\\u2019, hidden within the genomic habitat of their host cells. This perspective\\u2014viewing MGEs as evolving, self-interested, semi-autonomous actors in their own right\\u2014challenges the implicit coherence of the microbial individual, instead revealing genomes to be a contested space of competition and collaboration [10]. What are the implications for understanding MGEs, horizontal gene transfer and microbial evolution?2. In the driving seat: MGEs as vehicles for HGTMGEs are powerful drivers of HGT, and can have far-reaching effects that extend across microbial communities and beyond, to affect animals, plants, human health and disease, industry and the wider environment. Many ecologically-, clinically- and economically important traits are harboured and transmitted by MGEs, ranging from virulence, to resistance, to bioremediation, to metabolism [11\\u201315]. Indeed, the ability to confer beneficial traits on their hosts is the most conspicuous feature of many MGEs. The effects can be clearly seen in the emerging crisis of antimicrobial resistance, which, to a large extent, is driven by MGEs mobilizing antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) across species and genera [16]. To understand the propensity for ARG transfer, Wang et al. [17] studied the distribution of ARGs across plasmids and chromosomes in three groups of Enterobacteriaceae: Escherichia, Klebsiella and Salmonella. Certain types of resistance gene were more likely to be transmitted by plasmids than others. In particular, genes that caused antibiotic inactivation, or replacement or protection of the antibiotic's target, tended to be more common on plasmids than chromosomes, while resistance genes associated with efflux pumps tended to be more often chromosomally encoded. These patterns reflect broader trends in the susceptibility of genes to undergo HGT, with transfer of genes encoding proteins with multiple interaction partners (such as efflux pumps) proving less successfully transmitted than genes with fewer interactions (such as antibiotic inactivation) [18,19]. The recent global spread of ARGs is perhaps a case study, representative of broader patterns of a general, ubiquitous, ancient process of MGE-mediated gene exchange.While MGEs can spread useful genes, viewing the crucial benefits provided to microbial hosts from the perspective of the MGE itself reveals details and discrepancies that are fundamental to understanding how MGEs cause microbes to adapt. The nitrogen-fixing symbiosis genes of Rhizobia provide an instructive example. In their review on the subject, Wardell et al. [20] explain that the complex, multi-component and exquisitely coevolved symbiosis trait is encoded not as part of the core rhizobial genome but is instead located on mobile plasmids or integrative conjugative elements\\u2014imposing a fitness cost and impeding co-adaptation with the rest of the genome. Yet this phenomenon makes sense when considering the interests of the MGE and the symbiosis genes it carries: symbiosis mobility enables MGEs to take advantage of patchy selection in the heterogeneous soil environment, to sample different genomic environments, and facilitate competition between different symbiosis elements within the intracellular community.Taking an MGE's-eye-view to HGT also helps to explain the wide ranging changes to bacterial phenotypes resulting from plasmid acquisition. The accessory genes carried by plasmids can confer distinct, adaptive traits, but often the effects of plasmids extend much further, to significantly influence the expression of diverse resident genes. Billane et al. [21] argue that, rather than being maladaptive side-effects, these changes could be considered a manipulation of chromosomal genes to ultimately serve plasmid inclusive fitness. Drawing on diverse examples, including plasmids that rewire core metabolism, promote bacterial virulence, shut down interference competition mechanisms, or trigger biofilm production or motility, they show how plasmid-induced changes in bacterial phenotypes can ultimately favour plasmids, either through vertical or horizontal transmission.Overall then, though MGEs do act as vehicles of HGT for adaptive traits, they are self-driving autonomous vehicles. The evolutionary destination to which they are being pushed by selection may not be the same as that of their host cells [22]. Instead, MGEs are better conceptualized as fickle symbionts, existing on a continuum, with interactions that range from mutualistic to antagonistic depending on the genetic and environmental contexts [23].3. Contested spaces: conflicts between MGEs and resident genesMGEs have an intrinsic cost. Under some circumstances, these costs can be outweighed by the benefits of carrying the element, for example, when plasmids harbour accessory genes that are under positive selection [24]. But in most cases, such cargo remains beneficial if it happens to recombine onto the chromosome, leaving a redundant and burdensome MGE [25]. Understanding the source of MGE fitness costs is a major theme in current research. It has long been supposed that the metabolic costs associated with plasmid gene expression, and in particular, translation, make the principal contribution to observed plasmid fitness costs, because of the bioenergetic costs of amino acid biosynthesis and the fact that proteins tend to be more abundant than their corresponding DNA and transcripts [26]. Rodr\\u00edguez-Beltr\\u00e1n and colleagues [27] addressed the role of translation directly, by examining how plasmid fitness costs are affected in cells with translation defects. If translation were the dominant reason for plasmid costs, then cells with either reduced ribosome elongation rates or fewer ribosomes should suffer exacerbated fitness costs when they are inhabited by a plasmid. But this was not the case, and in fact, impeding translation appeared in some cases to reduce plasmid costs. These results suggest that generic mechanisms are less important for plasmid fitness costs than expected, and indicate instead that specific gene conflicts may be the predominant cause, a result that will probably generalize to other types of MGE.The role of specific genes in mediating the negative effects of plasmids is also supported by a study by Smith and colleagues [28]. Here, the authors examine a curious phenomenon that occurs when Pseudomonas species acquire the huge (976 kb) P. syringae plasmid pMPPla107: plasmid-carrying cells become sensitive to an unknown factor secreted by competitors during laboratory growth conditions [29]. The evolutionary reason for this sensitivity is unknown, but it can be abolished by evolution occurring in the laboratory, through a single nonsynonymous substitution in the hypothetical plasmid protein SkaA. It is not clear whether or how the wild-type version of skaA benefits the plasmid, but the gene appears to be essential for plasmid replication. Regardless, the fact that single basepair mutations can have such dramatic effects on costly plasmid-conferred phenotypes speaks to the importance of specific gene functions, and gene interactions within the context of a host cell [18,30]. With large MGEs carrying huge numbers of genes of unknown function and activity, there is great potential for conflicts to arise, and likewise for new adaptive phenotypes to emerge.Compensatory evolution can occur to resolve MGE-associated fitness costs [8]. If such mutations occur to chromosomal genes, then microbes that have compensated otherwise costly transmissible MGEs potentially have a double advantage: First, as the costs of MGE carriage are reduced, compensated cells benefit from enhanced absolute growth rates. And second, transmission of the costly MGE into uncompensated neighbours can increase growth of the donor strain relative to those competitors. In this case, the MGE would effectively act as an agent of \\u2018spiteful\\u2019 interference competition [31], a phenomenon explored by Domingues et al. [32]. Using a theoretical and individual-based modelling framework, they show that compensated plasmid donor cells may indeed use plasmids as weapons during competition within structured communities. In this context, it is interesting to consider that MGEs have provided the raw material for the evolution of other mechanisms of interference competition, including contact-dependent (type IV secretion) and contact-independent (tailocin) toxins [33,34].The burden imposed by MGEs drives the emergence of genome defences, which target horizontally-acquired DNA to prevent its establishment [35]. CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity is a common defence system in bacteria, and is a particularly rich source of information because CRISPR arrays present specific sequences matching their targets, often identifying the antagonising MGE [36]. Pursey et al. [37] interrogated a large genomic dataset to investigate whether, in repelling incoming MGEs, bacteria encoding CRISPR were also cutting themselves off from the flow of genetic information via HGT. Overall, they identified a negative association between ARGs and CRISPR-Cas, consistent with a model in which genome defences target vectors of ARGs, but in environments where antimicrobial resistance is beneficial, cells compromise their defences and lose CRISPR-Cas to gain the survival benefits of resistance. It could be that recent strong antibiotic selection has thus rendered many genomes prone to MGEs\\u2014an \\u2018immunocompromised state\\u2019 of which MGEs have taken advantage, undergoing rampant transmission, shaping and reshaping microbial genomes in their wake [38]. By opening up genomes to MGEs, anthropogenic antibiotic use may have radical effects on microbial genome evolution beyond simply promoting antimicrobial resistance.The power of MGEs to drive large-scale genome evolution is explored in the context of transposable elements (TEs) by van Dijk et al. [39] in a series of individual-based models that investigate the relationship between TEs and genome streamlining. TEs can wreck their host cells if they insert into an essential gene, and thus highly streamlined genomes are exceptionally susceptible to damaging TE activity. This susceptibility is bad for individual cells, but tends to purge populations of TEs, because TEs also lose out if their host microbe is killed. On the other hand, genomes with redundancy, for example with gene duplications, provide a safer habitat for TEs, because transposition is less likely to disrupt essential genome functions. The predicted consequences are a rock\\u2013paper\\u2013scissors dynamic that can explain long-term associations between TEs and their hosts, as well as broader patterns in genome evolution and compactness.The conflicts between MGEs and resident microbial genes thus extend beyond the generic metabolic burdens of MGE gene expression, and instead emerge from particular functions and evolutionary trade-offs. Characterizing these conflicts, and how they are resolved, will help explain patterns of gene acquisition and loss, and identify key species responsible for harbouring and disseminating MGEs in communities.4. MGEs in an MGE worldAn MGE is seldom alone. Indeed, MGEs live in a world inhabited by other MGEs, and the genome might well be envisaged as an ecosystem in itself, with many co-existing and interacting agents. Many plasmids, for example, inhabit cells with at least one other plasmid [40], and there are diverse mechanisms by which plasmids can interact to affect conjugation, co-infection and fitness costs [41]. The implication of such plasmid \\u2018co-infection\\u2019 is formally investigated in a framework presented by Igler et al. [42]. A salient feature of their models is the emergence of frequency-dependent selection, which varies in nature from positive to negative depending on epistasis between the plasmids. Where plasmids reduce one anothers' costs, the co-infected state is favoured, causing rare plasmids to spread, whereas if plasmids exacerbate one anothers\\u2019 costs then rare plasmids are suppressed by dominant ones. The fact that the presence of other plasmids in a community can dramatically affect plasmid fate underlines the importance of considering the effects of a plasmid in the context of other MGEs.Conflicts and collaborations between MGEs also extend across MGE types. In a series of experiments extended and explored with deterministic modelling, Igler et al. [43] investigate how conjugative plasmids and integrative prophages affect each other's transmission. Though neither the plasmid nor the phage used in their experiments (lambda and RP4) contained systems known to directly interfere with transfer, they found that prophages limited conjugative plasmid spread directly by killing recipients, and suggest that prophages may also inhibit plasmid entry. By contrast, in environments with high rates of phage infection, plasmids can benefit from the superinfection immunity provided by a prophage, and are likely to evolve higher conjugation rates in response. In diverse ecosystems, phage infection drives microbial ecology [15], and this context is likely to shape the activity and behaviour of many MGEs, both directly and indirectly.Indeed, some MGEs have adapted to parasitize phage transmission processes for their own advantage. Satellites are unable to package and transmit themselves, and instead hijack the machinery of phages [44]. P4-like satellites parasitize P2-like phages in Enterobacterales, and de Sousa et al. [45] perform a comprehensive overview of the abundance and genetic diversity of these distinct, broadly distributed, and ancient family of MGEs, related neither to phages nor to plasmids. They identify P4-like elements in almost a third of Enterobacterales genomes, and show phylogenetically that these elements have proliferated by HGT across species. Hyperparasitism\\u2014being parasitic on a parasite\\u2014is a major emerging theme in MGE biology, with Staphylococcus pathogenicity islands (SaPIs), phage-like elements (PLE) and phage-inducible chromsomal islands (PICI) also manifesting this strategy [46]. In some cases, MGE hyperparasites offer powerful evolutionary opportunities to their microbial hosts by providing some defence against a heavy burden of phage infection [47]. Viewing this relationship from the perspective of the hyperparasite reveals conflicting evolutionary pressures as these semi-autonomous, but heavily dependent, elements co-evolve with their host bacteriophage and their broader genomic milieu.Pervasive MGE\\u2013MGE competition can also cast MGE accessory traits in a new light. Virus\\u2013host mutualism, in which viruses confer beneficial traits on their infected hosts, is widespread [48]. One common mechanism, found across bacteria, is where phages encode toxins that facilitate inter-strain interference competition [49]. Sulfolobus islandicus, a hyperthermophilic Archaeal denizen of volcanic hot springs, can be chronically infected with the virus Sulfolobus spindle-shaped virus 9 (SSV9). Chronic infection imposes only a small fitness cost, because SSV9 reproduces by budding from host cells, without lysis. In fact, in communities, SSV9 provides a competitive advantage over uninfected strains [50]. DeWerff et al. [51] demonstrate that this advantage is due to a virus-encoded specific toxin protein that kills competitors. From the perspective of the virus, killing potential hosts seems counterintuitive, but experiments combined with comparative genomics revealed that related spindle-shaped viruses carry different toxin variants, and it was the carriage of a heterologous virus that rendered strains vulnerable to a toxin. This complex network of cross-targeting makes sense in the context of virus\\u2013virus competition, with the host cells caught in the cross-fire.Together, the understanding that MGEs are adapted for interactions with other MGEs, just as much as (if not more than) for dealing with core chromosomal genes, challenges the conception of microbial individuals as the principal agents adapting in microbiomes. Instead, these findings provoke a more pluralistic model, in which chromosomes and MGEs are nodes in an interacting, coevolving network.5. The diversity of the MGE menagerieBy providing a window into the world of MGEs, genome sequencing has cast light on hidden diversity that would otherwise have remained invisible [52]. Santamar\\u00eda et al. [53] focus their attention on the phages of Rhizobium species, which remained poorly understood, despite the crucial ecological and economic importance of this nitrogen-fixing genus. Comparative genomics revealed dozens of viral clusters and the widespread presence of prophage in Rhizobium across species and geographic locations, indicating that some phages have wide distribution and host range while others remained more tightly associated. Interestingly, only a small proportion of Rhizobium prophages were intact, suggesting that within genomes, prophage are subjected to an ongoing process of degradation. Selection at the level of the microbial host often disfavours MGE independence, driving mutations that prevent MGE transmission (such as the loss of genes for packaging) but retaining genes for the benefit of the host [33,54]. As a consequence, such \\u2018domesticated\\u2019 prophage can be shorter than known-to-be active phage. Pattenden and colleagues [55] developed a model that combines genome sequencing data with measurements of growth characteristics, to investigate how the life history traits of host bacteria influence the length and gene content of putative prophages. While fast-growing hosts displayed a clear bimodal distribution in prophage lengths, slower-growing hosts, and those unlikely to be pathogenic, were relatively depleted in the longer, intact prophage and exhibited a lower rate of prophage induction. These properties are likely to reflect the relative stability of those slower-growing strains, which are less likely to experience boom-and-bust growth cycles and the associated stresses. Such patterns illustrate the dynamic evolution of MGEs in the context of organismal genomes, demonstrating how varied selection pressures can dissociate self-reproducing MGEs into constituent modules.Advances in long-read sequencing have also enabled larger, repetitive MGEs to be completely assembled and studied, and recent years have seen an increase in the identification of super-sized MGEs, including megaplasmids, which in some cases represent megabases of DNA and harbour hundreds of genes [56,57]. With plasmid size spanning three orders of magnitude, what factors drive megaplasmids to become so large, and what are the consequences for microbial genome evolution? In their review of the field, Hall et al. [58] suggest that while there is no meaningful size threshold for assigning megaplasmid status, distinct selective pressures can favour and stabilize larger plasmids and their magnified capacity for HGT.Comparative genomics is likewise uncovering the opportunism and mosaicism that have emerged as a defining feature of MGE evolution. The plasmids of the agrobacteria\\u2013rhizobia complex provide a graphic example. Analysing over 4000 plasmid sequences from this agriculturally-, biotechnologically- and ecologically-important group, Weisberg et al. [59] focus on the evolution of the characteristic oncogenic plasmids that are associated with plant disease, finding pervasive hallmarks of recombination and reshuffling that have generated plasmids with new combinations of genes, able to confer pathogenicity to new lineages. In particular, the underexplored accessory plasmids of the complex, which are thought to mainly confer catabolic traits, appear to have contributed key regions and genes, accelerating diversification and extending the functions of virulence plasmids.The diversity of MGEs uncovered to date is likely to represent just the tip of the iceberg, as technological developments, including long read sequencing, contact sequencing and metagenome assemblies continue to reveal and define the biology of new elements [52,57,60,61]. There is surely much to be discovered, particularly from environmental microbes and those yet to be cultured.6. New perspectives on microbial identitiesExposing the secret lives of MGEs, through sequencing, experiments and modelling, is beginning to force a change in the perspective that has dominated microbiology since those first observations of individual microbes hundreds of years ago. Viewing MGEs as more than simply extensions of their host microbes, and instead as adapting, fitness-maximizing agents in their own right, enables us to draw on a wider range of conceptual frameworks for understanding their behaviour. In a thought-provoking opinion piece, Ghaly et al. [62] provide three complementary viewpoints for understanding and controlling MGEs in the context of antimicrobial resistance. MGEs can be conceptualized as biological individuals, as pollutants, and as invasive species, with each of these presentations inviting distinct interventions. For example, by viewing MGEs as biological individuals, attempts could be made to target MGE replication specifically through use of conjugation inhibitors or CRISPR, reducing the collateral damage to their host cells. As pollutants, MGEs could be targeted by adapting methods of wastewater treatment. And as invasive species, we might use tactics used in larger-organism ecology to make communities more stable against invasion. Though focused on controlling the spread of resistance, strategies drawing on such alternative perspectives are more widely applicable, for example, because influencing and controlling MGE activity could facilitate bioaugmentation of microbiomes through introduction of beneficial traits [11].The realization, stemming from those original microscopic studies, that we live in a microbial world pervaded by tiny lives, is a powerful one, and continues to shape our understanding of health, disease and ecosystem function. We believe that understanding MGEs on their own terms, and uncovering their \\u2018secret lives\\u2019 in the process, will ultimately spur new ways of studying, influencing, and comprehending microbiomes, and to advance this perspective, we are proud to present this Theme Issue.Data accessibilityThis article has no additional data.Authors' contributionsAll authors contributed to the final manuscript.Competing interestsWe declare we have no competing interests.FundingE.H. is supported by the RCUK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) via an independent research fellowship (NE/P017584/1).AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to all authors for their contributions, and to Editor Helen Eaton for support and guidance during the whole process.Authors' profileJames P. J. Hall is a Tenure Track Fellow in the Department of Evolution, Ecology and Behaviour at the University of Liverpool. Having studied evolution in eukaryotes, viruses and bacteria, he became captivated by the multifarious relationships that MGEs have with one another and with their host microorganisms, and his current focus is on the evolutionary ecology of plasmid-mediated HGT in microbial communities.Ellie Harrison is a Tenure Track NERC Fellow in the School of Biosciences at the University of Sheffield. She is interested in the forces that shape microbial communities, often addressing this question at the sub-cellular level, focused on the menagerie of MGEs that exist within and between bacterial genomes. At present, her research focuses on MGEs in Rhizobia: the bacteria that (sometimes) live in the roots of legumes and provide them with lovely nitrogen.David A. Baltrus is an Associate Professor in the School of Plant Sciences at the University of Arizona. His current research broadly focuses on interactions between microbes and (many) other organisms. While the pervasive nature and evolutionary dynamics of MGEs across all these interactions often makes no sense, trying to grasp their importance certainly compels him.FootnotesOne contribution of 18 to a theme issue \\u2018The secret lives of microbial mobile genetic elements\\u2019.\\u00a9 2021 The Authors.Published by the Royal Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/, which permits unrestricted use, provided the original author and source are credited.References1.

Once a lead compound has been identified and optimised, they are subject to intensive pre-clinical research to determine their pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties, procedures which inevitably involve significant numbers of animals - mainly mice and rats, but also dogs and monkeys in much smaller numbers and for specific types of drug candidates. Many compounds that emerge from this process, having been shown to be safe and efficacious in pre-clinical studies, subsequently fail to replicate this outcome in clinical trials, therefore wasting time, money and, most importantly, animals. The poor predictive power of animal models in pre-clinical studies is predominantly due to lack of efficacy or safety reasons, which in turn can be attributed mainly to the significant species differences in drug metabolism between humans and animals. To circumvent this, we have developed a complex transgenic mouse model - 8HUM - which faithfully replicates human Phase I drug metabolism (and its regulation), and which will generate more human-relevant data [ REFINEMENT] from fewer animals [ REDUCTION] in a pre-clinical setting and reduce attrition in the clinic. One key area for the pre-clinical application of animals in an oncology setting - almost exclusively mice - is their use in anti-tumour studies. We now further demonstrate the utility of the 8HUM mouse using a murine melanoma cell line as a syngeneic tumour and also present an immunodeficient version 8HUM_Rag2 -/- - for use in xenograft studies. These models will be of significant benefit not only to Pharma for pre-clinical drug development work, but also throughout the drug efficacy, toxicology, pharmacology, and drug metabolism communities, where fewer animals will be needed to generate more human-relevant data.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.122987.1\", \"publication_date\": \"2022-09-21\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4381469587\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1021/jacs.3c02742\", \"af_direct_citation\": 1, \"af_indirect_citations\": 7, \"title\": \"Design of Heme Enzymes with a Tunable Substrate Binding Pocket Adjacent to an Open Metal Coordination Site\", \"abstract\": \"The catalytic versatility of pentacoordinated iron is highlighted by the broad range of natural and engineered activities of heme enzymes such as cytochrome P450s, which position a porphyrin cofactor coordinating a central iron atom below an open substrate binding pocket.

A family of proteins that have long been pursued as potential intervention targets are aquaporins which are channels facilitating the movement of water and other solutes across membranes. We identify a new aquaporin in malaria parasites and demonstrate that it is essential for disease transmission through mosquitoes. Disruption of AQP2 in the human parasite Plasmodium falciparum and the rodent parasite Plasmodium berghei blocks sporozoite production inside oocysts established on mosquito midguts, preventing parasite infection of salivary glands and transmission to a new host. In vivo epitope tagging of AQP2 in P. berghei , combined with immunofluorescence assays, reveals that the protein is localized in previously uncharacterized organelles found in the cytoplasm of gametocytes, ookinetes and sporozoites. The number of these organelles varies between individual parasites and lifecycle stages suggesting that they are likely part of a dynamic endolysosomal system. Phylogenetic analysis confirms that AQP2 is unique to malaria and closely related parasites and most closely related to other intracellular aquaporins. Structure prediction analyses identify several unusual features, including a large accessory extracellular loop and an arginine-to-phenylalanine substitution in the selectivity filter principally determining pore function, a unique feature not found in any aquaporins studied to date.

Enzymes have rapidly evolved to hydrolyze phosphate triesters in response to this challenge, converging onto the same mechanistic solution, which requires bivalent cations as a cofactor for catalysis. In contrast, the previously identified metagenomic promiscuous hydrolase P91, a homologue of acetylcholinesterase, achieves slow phosphotriester hydrolysis mediated by a metal-independent Cys-His-Asp triad.

Unlike its homologue acetylcholinesterase, P91 does not suffer suicide inhibition; instead, fast dephosphorylation rates make the formation of the covalent adduct rather than its hydrolysis rate-limiting. This step is improved by directed evolution, with intermediate formation accelerated by 2 orders of magnitude.

Explicit solvent methods coupled to molecular dynamics simulation are increasingly complementing lower resolution implicit solvent techniques, but equally, the scale of biological data acquisition leaves a role for high-throughput modeling. Additionally, determination of ranges of structures for a system allows sampling of key stages in solvation. In a review of the area, it is emphasized that pH sensors in biology beyond the most obvious candidate (histidine side chain, with an unshifted p K a near neutral pH) should be considered; that modeling can benefit from other concepts in bioinformatics, in particular modulation of interactions and function in families of homologs; and that it can also be beneficial to incorporate as many experimental structures as possible, to mitigate against small variations in conformation and to analyze larger, functional, conformational changes.

Droplet-on-demand systems satisfy this need but extracting large amounts of data is challenging. Here we introduce a multiplexed droplet absorbance detector which, coupled to semi-automated droplet generation, forms a tubing-based droplet-on-demand system able to generate and extract quantitative datasets from defined concentration gradients across multiple series of droplets for multiple time points. The emergence of product is detected by reading the absorbance of the droplet sets at multiple, adjustable time points (reversing the flow direction after each detection, so that the droplets pass a line scan camera multiple times). Detection multiplexing allows absorbance values at twelve distinct positions to be measured and enzyme kinetics are recorded for label-free concentration gradients (composed of about 60 droplets each, covering as many concentrations). With a throughput of around 8640 data points per hour, a 10-fold improvement compared to the previously reported single point detection method is achieved.

By sizing windows based on the number of variant carriers, rather than the number of variants or nucleotides, statistical power is held constant during analysis, enabling the localization of clinical impact as well as the removal of unassociated gene regions. This method can be used to focus on: specific variant types such as loss of function (LoF) or other coding; parts of a gene, such as those expressed in different tissues; or isolating gene regions with opposite directions of effect. Using a training set of 300K exomes from the UKBiobank (UKB), we developed PW-based LoF and coding models for well-established gene-disease associations and tested their accuracy in two additional cohorts (128k exomes from the UKB and 30k exomes from the Healthy Nevada Project (HNP)). The significant PW models retained a mean of 64% of the rare variant carriers in each gene (range 16-98%), with quantitative traits showing a mean effect size improvement of 48% compared to aggregating rare variants across the entire gene, and the odds ratios for binary traits improving by a mean of 2.4-fold.

We determined plasmid transfer from a clinical isolate, CPE16, which carried four plasmids, including the 119-kbp blaNDM-1-bearing F-type plasmid pCPE16_3, in planktonic and biofilm conditions. We found that transfer frequency of pCPE16_3 in a biofilm was orders-of-magnitude higher than between planktonic cells. In 5/7 sequenced transconjugants (TCs) multiple plasmids had transferred. Plasmid acquisition had no detectable growth impact on TCs. Gene expression of the recipient and a transconjugant was investigated by RNA-sequencing in three lifestyles: planktonic exponential growth, planktonic stationary phase, and biofilm. We found that lifestyle had a substantial impact on chromosomal gene expression, and plasmid carriage affected chromosomal gene expression most in stationary planktonic and biofilm lifestyles. Furthermore, expression of plasmid genes was lifestyle-dependent, with distinct signatures across the three conditions. Our study shows that growth in biofilm greatly increased the risk of conjugative transfer of a carbapenem resistance plasmid in K. pneumoniae without fitness costs and minimal transcriptional rearrangements, thus highlighting the importance of biofilms in the spread of AMR in this opportunistic pathogen. IMPORTANCE Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae is particularly problematic in hospital settings. Carbapenem resistance genes can transfer between bacteria via plasmid conjugation. Alongside drug resistance, K. pneumoniae can form biofilms on hospital surfaces, at infection sites and on implanted devices. Biofilms are naturally protected and can be inherently more tolerant to antimicrobials than their free-floating counterparts.

Therefore, we aimed to explore the transfer of a plasmid in planktonic and biofilm conditions, and the impact of plasmid acquisition on a new bacterial host.

How established polyploids adapt their meiotic behaviour to ensure genome stability and accurate chromosome segregation remains an active research question. We present here a cytological description of meiosis in the model allopolyploid species Arabidopsis suecica (2n = 4x = 26). In large part meiosis in A. suecica is diploid-like, with normal synaptic progression and no evidence of synaptic partner exchanges. Some abnormalities were seen at low frequency, including univalents at metaphase I, anaphase bridges and aneuploidy at metaphase II; however, we saw no evidence of crossover formation occurring between non-homologous chromosomes. The crossover number in A. suecica is similar to the combined number reported from its diploid parents Arabidopsis thaliana (2n = 2x = 10) and Arabidopsis arenosa (2n = 2x = 16), with an average of approximately 1.75 crossovers per chromosome pair. This contrasts with naturally evolved autotetraploid A. arenosa, where accurate chromosome segregation is achieved by restricting crossovers to approximately 1 per chromosome pair. Although an autotetraploid donor is hypothesized to have contributed the A. arenosa subgenome to A. suecica, A. suecica harbours diploid A. arenosa variants of key meiotic genes. These multiple lines of evidence suggest that meiosis in the recently evolved allopolyploid A. suecica is essentially diploid like, with meiotic adaptation following a very different trajectory to that described for autotetraploid A. arenosa.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.15879\", \"publication_date\": \"2022-07-22\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W3208999135\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1016/j.jmb.2021.167336\", \"af_direct_citation\": 1, \"af_indirect_citations\": 7, \"title\": \"The AlphaFold Database of Protein Structures: A Biologist\\u2019s Guide\", \"abstract\": \"AlphaFold, the deep learning algorithm developed by DeepMind, recently released the three-dimensional models of the whole human proteome to the scientific community.

Despite a high level of sequence and structure conservation, subtle differences in their design principles determine the interaction with myosin motors and actin-binding proteins. Therefore, identifying how the structure of actin isoforms relates to function is important for our understanding of normal cytoskeletal physiology. Here, we report the high-resolution structures of filamentous skeletal muscle \\u03b1-actin (3.37 \\u00c5), cardiac muscle \\u03b1-actin (3.07 \\u00c5), \\u00df-actin (2.99 \\u00c5), and \\u03b3-actin (3.38 \\u00c5) in the Mg2+\\u00b7ADP state with their native post-translational modifications. The structures revealed isoform-specific conformations of the N-terminus that shift closer to the filament surface upon myosin binding, thereby establishing isoform-specific interfaces. Collectively, the structures of single-isotype, post-translationally modified bare skeletal muscle \\u03b1-actin, cardiac muscle \\u03b1-actin, \\u00df-actin, and \\u03b3-actin reveal general principles, similarities, and differences between isoforms. They complement the repertoire of known actin structures and allow for a comprehensive understanding of in vitro and in vivo functions of actin isoforms.The protein actin is important for many fundamental processes in biology, from contracting muscle to dividing a cell in two. As actin is involved in such a variety of roles, human cells have slightly different versions of the protein, known as isoforms. For example, alpha-actin is vital for contracting muscle, while beta- and gamma-actin drive cellular processes in non-muscle cells. In order to carry out its various functions, actin interacts with many other proteins inside the cell, such as myosin motors which power muscle contraction. These interactions rely on the precise chain of building blocks, known as amino acids, that make up the actin isoforms; even subtle alterations in this sequence can influence the behavior of the protein. However, it is not clear how differences in the amino acid sequence of the actin isoforms impact actin\\u2019s interactions with other proteins. Arora et al. addressed this by studying the structure of four human actin isoforms using a technique called cryo-electron microscopy, where the proteins are flash-frozen and bombarded with electrons. These experiments showed where differences between the amino acid chains of each isoform were located in the protein. Arora et al. then compared their structures with previous work showing the structure of actin bound to myosin. This revealed that the tail-end of the protein (known as the N-terminus) differed in shape between the four isoforms, and this variation may influence how actin binds to others proteins in the cell. These results are an important foundation for further work on actin and how it interacts with other proteins. The structures could help researchers design new tools that can be used to target specific isoforms of actin in different types of laboratory experiments.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.82015\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-02-15\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4210916320\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1002/anie.202117324\", \"af_direct_citation\": 1, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"Carboxyl Methyltransferase Catalysed Formation of Mono\\u2010 and Dimethyl Esters under Aqueous Conditions: Application in Cascade Biocatalysis\", \"abstract\": \"Carboxyl methyltransferase (CMT) enzymes catalyse the biomethylation of carboxylic acids under aqueous conditions and have potential for use in synthetic enzyme cascades.

We performed two independent cell-based systematic screens to determine whether there are additional proteins by which the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 can interact with human cells. We discovered that in addition to ACE2, expression of LRRC15 also causes spike protein binding. This interaction is distinct from other known spike attachment mechanisms such as heparan sulfates or lectin receptors.

We localized the interaction to the C-terminus of the S1 domain and showed that LRRC15 shares recognition of the ACE2 receptor binding domain. From analyzing proteomics and single-cell transcriptomics, we identify LRRC15 expression as being common in human lung vasculature cells and fibroblasts. Levels of LRRC15 were greatly elevated by inflammatory signals in the lungs of COVID-19 patients.

As a graduate student in the late 1980s, I was drawn to the challenge of the protein-folding problem and to using protein design as a means of testing our understanding of protein structure and folding. Even then, we suspected that solutions to these problems would come through bioinformatics. However, we did not realize how long it would take for solutions to come or the form that they would take in terms of combining big data, large computer power, and artificial intelligence, specifically, machine learning. Of course, I refer to the recent successes AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold in predicting protein structure from sequence alone (1AlQuraishi M. AlphaFold at CASP13.Bioinformatics. 2019; 35: 4862-4865Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 2Baek M. DiMaio F. Anishchenko I. Dauparas J. Ovchinnikov S.

Like many, when I look at an AlphaFold2 model for a complex protein assembly, I am awestruck by the structural solutions that it finds. However, while AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold provide solutions to the protein-folding problem\\u2014and, to be sure, these and other methods will improve to provide models for ever-more complex protein structures and assemblies\\u2014they are just that, solutions. In themselves, they do not necessarily, at least not at present, provide an understanding of the physics and chemistry that drives and directs protein folding and assembly, which, in turn, are responsible for protein function. Back in the 1980s and 1990s, it was the desire to understand protein folding that drove interest in the field; it was not just to find solutions to the problem per se. In short, we wanted to understand the physico-chemical principles that underpin protein structure, folding, assembly, and stability. In other words, we sought to decipher the underlying sequence-to-structure relationships for these properties. This perspective is about how far we have progressed in understanding protein folding and design in these terms. Well, at least for one particular protein structure\\u2014the \\u03b1-helical coiled coil. At first sight, this is a relatively straightforward peptide and protein assembly in which two or more \\u03b1-helical chains wrap around each other to form supercoiled or rope-like structures, Figure 1. At that time, coiled-coil\\u2013forming leucine-zipper peptides, Figure 1A, became models for protein folding and design (5Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. Mcknight S.L.

Evidence that the leucine zipper is a coiled coil.Science. 1989; 243: 538-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). I was drawn to the folding and design of leucine zippers as a post-doc with Tom Alber in the early 1990s. This was because of the apparent simplicity of these coiled coils and the thought that unless we could understand such simple protein folds and assemblies, we would have no hope with more complex globular proteins. Therefore, I adopted coiled coils as a model for developing an understanding of sequence-to-structure relationships in proteins. An aim of this perspective is to capture some of that journey, which has been contributed to by many scientists in many groups over the past few decades. However, it is not a complete review of coiled-coil structure, biology, or even design. Such an article would be redundant because many excellent reviews are already available (8Lupas A.

Instead, I want to give some sense of three things: first, of the journey and the joy of discovery, which have led to our current understanding of this relatively straightforward protein structure; second, that in some respects\\u2014for instance, the physics and chemistry of coiled-coil folding and assembly\\u2014our understanding is complete or very near to it; and third, despite this understanding, we still have much to learn, particularly on the biology of coiled coils. This article is my perspective on the amassed understanding of coiled-coil proteins. Indeed, it closes some of my own research questions; namely, what are the sequence-to-structure relationships that govern coiled-coil folding and assembly, and how do these allow us to design de novo coiled coils with confidence? However, as some research chapters close, others open. For coiled-coil research, new challenges include the following: achieving fully quantitative (free-energy) predictions for coiled-coil structure, stability, and partner selection; gaining a deeper understanding of coiled-coil dynamics and plasticity and how this relates to coiled-coil function. And, as one of the best understood protein folds, how can de novo coiled-coil peptides and proteins be used in biotechnology and synthetic biology to address real-world applications, for instance, in health and the environment. I am certain that the methods, principles, and understanding that have been developed over the past few decades will provide a foundation for these and other endeavors. And to come full circle, it is clear that new artificial intelligence/machine learning\\u2013based methods for protein-structure prediction will contribute here. Indeed, I see these tools as fantastic hypothesis generators for structural molecular and cell biology, including for processes that involve relatively simple, but adaptable and versatile coiled coils. For more complete historical perspectives on the conceptual origins of \\u03b1-helical coiled coils, please see reviews by Squire and Parry and by Lupas et al. (19Lupas A.N. Gruber M.

Fibrous protein structures: hierarchy, history and heroes.Subcell Biochem. 2017; 82: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The coiled coil came out of physics: Francis Crick\\u2019s description of the coiled coil, as he first named it, is mathematical (22Crick F.H.C. The fourier transform of a coiled-coil.Acta Crystallogr. 1953; 6: 685-689Crossref Google Scholar, 23Crick F.H.C. The packing of alpha-helices - simple coiled-coils.Acta Crystallogr. 1953; 6: 689-697Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, at that time in the early 1950s, there was little experimental data or confirmed details for any protein structure. So, what followed\\u2014namely, the first description of any protein structure, the concepts of helical nets and knobs-into-holes (KIH) packing, heptad repeats, and what we now refer to as the Crick Equations\\u2014was extremely insightful. Incidentally, Crick published this work in the same year that he and James Watson proposed the double helix for the structure of DNA (24Watson J.D. Crick F.H.C. Molecular structure of nucleic acids - a structure for deoxyribose nucleic acid.Nature. 1953; 171: 737-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Crick started with Linus Pauling\\u2019s \\u03b1 helix and its regularity (Fig. 2A) (25Pauling L. Corey R.B. Branson H.R. The structure of proteins - 2 hydrogen-bonded helical configurations of the polypeptide chain.Pro. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1951; 37: 205-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence of steric constraints in polypeptide chains\\u2014as later formalized by Ramachandran in his famous plot (26Ramachandran G.N. Ramakrishnan C. Sasisekharan V. Stereochemistry of polypeptide chain configurations.J. Mol. Biol. 1963; 7: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar, 27Ramachandran G.N. Venkatachalam C.M. Krimm S. Stereochemical criteria for polypeptide and protein chain conformations .3. Helical and hydrogen-bonded polypeptide chains.Biophys. J. 1966; 6: 849-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)\\u2014the \\u03b1 helix has precisely 3.6 residues per turn (Fig. 2A). Crick reasoned that two or more such helices could interact tightly via seams of interacting side chains spaced three and four residues apart along polypeptide chains\\u2014i.e., with an average spacing of 3.5 residues\\u2014to match the 3.6 residues per turn as closely as possible. Now, we annotate these repeats abcdefg with the key interacting side chains falling at the a and d sites. Crick visualized this with helical-net diagrams (Fig. 2B). Highlighting the 3,4 spacing on one of these reveals the seam as the line of connected diamond shapes. Two such seams can interlace to bring the helices into intimate contact (Fig. 2C): the diamonds on one helix form \\u2018holes\\u2019 into which side chains from the other helix can slot. In this way, Crick coined the terms \\u2018heptad repeat\\u2019 (from the Greek for seven) and KIH packing for these sequence and structural features, respectively. These are now the hallmarks for coiled-coil peptides and proteins, and they provide a firm basis for understanding them. The term \\u2018coiled coil\\u2019 is a consequence of these sequence patterns and the structural packing. This is because 3.5 is less than 3.6. As a result, on a helical net, the seam slants to the left (Fig. 2B). Thus, for two nets to interlace requires one to be offset at an angle to the other (Fig. 2C). In a 3D \\u03b1 helix, the seam precesses around the surface of the helix with the opposite sense to the handedness of the helix. Thus, for two \\u03b1 helices to maintain contact, they must wrap around each other like the strands of a rope. As \\u03b1 helices made from l-amino acids are right handed, heptad-based coiled coils are left-handed ropes. This overall assembly\\u2014which is a quaternary structure and not a tertiary structure\\u2014is also helical. Strictly, it is a superhelix. This is why Crick called the envisaged structures coiled coils; \\u201ccoils\\u201d refers to the \\u03b1 helices, and \\u201ccoiled\\u201d refers to the superhelix. From Pauling\\u2019s \\u03b1-helical parameters\\u20143.6 residues per turn and a rise per residues of 1.5 \\u00c5\\u2014Crick predicted that the crossing angle between the two helices would be \\u224820\\u02da, which gives a superhelical pitch of \\u2248126 residues or \\u2248186 \\u00c5 (Box 1). (Note: these values correspond to those observed in experimentally determined coiled coils (28Grigoryan G. DeGrado W.F. Probing designability via a generalized model of helical bundle geometry.J.

This is formalized in the Crick Equations. Thus, the coiled coil is inherently parametric, which makes it physics, predictable, modelable and, as, we will see, ultimately designable (28Grigoryan G.

This has made coiled-coil modeling, engineering, and design accessible to nonexperts, which is a significant advance. In turn, this has enabled the exploration of coiled-coil assemblies beyond the confines of natural proteins (34Thomson A.R. Wood C.W. Burton A.J. Bartlett G.J. Sessions R.B.

Sci. 2021; 12: 6923-6928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Box 1From \\u03b1-helical to coiled-coil parametersThe following exercise can be done by considering projections of the \\u03b1 helix as helical nets or helical wheels.First, I need to dispel a key misconception made by students and professors alike. Pauling\\u2019s \\u03b1 helix has 3.6 residues per turn with a very low tolerance of variation (29Wood C.W. Bruning M. Ibarra A.A. Bartlett G.J. Thomson A.R. Sessions R.B. et al.CCBuilder: an interactive web-based tool for building, designing and assessing coiled-coil protein assemblies.Bioinformatics. 2014; 30: 3029-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); indeed, this is one of the few fixed physical constants in biology (52Kumar P. Paterson N.G. Clayden J. Woolfson D.N. De novo design of discrete, stable 310-helix peptide assemblies.Nature. 2022; 607: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). This is because the energy well for the \\u03b1 helix is narrow and deep (53Kuster D.J. Liu C.Y. Fang Z. Ponder J.W. Marshall G.R. High-resolution crystal structures of protein helices reconciled with three-centered hydrogen bonds and multipole electrostatics.PLoS One. 2015; 10: e0123146Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and small deviations from \\u03b1-helical parameters incur large energy penalties. Indeed, the nearby 310 and \\u03c0 helixes are rare in protein structures and difficult to design (52Kumar P. Paterson N.G. Clayden J. Woolfson D.N. De novo design of discrete, stable 310-helix peptide assemblies.Nature. 2022; 607: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). As a result, the \\u03b1 helix does not somehow collapse to 3.5 residues per turn in coiled coils. If it did, we would not have coiled coils: the average sequence repeat of 3.5 and a helical repeat of 3.5 would match, and the helices would pack straight and not wrap around each other. I suspect that the convenience of 7-residue helical wheels (Fig. 2D) rather than the more accurate 18-residues helical wheels (Fig. 2E) has contributed to this misconception. Crick\\u2019s helical nets are a more faithful mapping of an \\u03b1-helical surface in 2D (Fig. 2B).With the C\\u03b1 atoms of an \\u03b1 helix projected on an 18-residue helical wheel, successive residues are separated by 100\\u02da. Thus, the seven residues of a heptad repeat would span out 700\\u02da. This is 20\\u02da short of two full turns (2 \\u00d7 360\\u02da = 720\\u02da and 7.2 residues) of the \\u03b1 helix. 20\\u02da goes into 360\\u02da 18 times. Therefore, 18 heptad repeats are required for the interacting seam to make one complete revolution of a helix and to bring the helices back into sync. This defines the pitch of the coiled coil. Hence, the pitch is 18 \\u00d7 7 = 126 residues. Given that the \\u03b1 helix has a rise per residue of 1.5 \\u00c5, these would span 189 \\u00c5 of a straight \\u03b1 helix. However, each \\u03b1 helix is inclined by \\u224810\\u02da relative to the superhelical axis. Therefore, the rise per residue along this coiled-coil axis is 1.5 \\u00d7 cos(10\\u02da) = 1.48 \\u00c5, and the ideal superhelical pitch is \\u2248186 \\u00c5 (Fig. 2F). In addition to the rise per residue and the coiled-coil pitch, just two other parameters are needed to define and generate regular coiled-coil backbones. These are the radius of the coiled coil and the interface or Crick angle, Figure 2G.Finally for this Box, we should also credit Pauling. Crick considered only 7-residue repeats. However, Pauling et al. considered other repeats in \\u03b1-helical conformations, specifically, those with 11, 15, and 18 residues (25Pauling L. Corey R.B. Branson H.R. The structure of proteins - 2 hydrogen-bonded helical configurations of the polypeptide chain.Pro. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1951; 37: 205-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Pauling L. Corey R.B. The structure of synthetic polypeptides.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1951; 37: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Along with 7-residue repeats, these are compatible with combinations of 3- and 4-residue spacings; namely, 3-4, 3-4-4, 3-4-4-4, and 3-4-3-4-4, respectively. However, they have different average spacings between the interacting residues of 3.5, 3.67, 3.75, and 3.6, respectively. As the \\u03b1-helical structural repeat is fixed at 3.6 residues per turn, when these repeats are realized in packed coiled coils, they lead to different superhelical twists. These can also be calculated using the considerations laid out above. They result in further left-handed, some right-handed, and even \\u201cstraight\\u201d coiled coils (19Lupas A.N. Gruber M.

Cellular studies indicate that the lead compounds display similar phenotypes as reported for clinically observed JMJD5 variants, which have a reduced catalytic activity compared to wild-type JMJD5.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.3c01114\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-08-01\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4200558169\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1101/2021.12.20.473413\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"Integrated view and comparative analysis of baseline protein expression in mouse and rat tissues\", \"abstract\": \"Abstract The increasingly large amount of proteomics data in the public domain enables, among other applications, the combined analyses of datasets to create comparative protein expression maps covering different organisms and different biological conditions.

We elucidate the role of EROS, showing it acts at the earliest stages of gp91phox maturation. It binds the immature 58 kDa gp91phox directly, preventing gp91phox degradation and allowing glycosylation via the oligosaccharyltransferase machinery and the incorporation of the heme prosthetic groups essential for catalysis.

De novo phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis via the Kennedy pathway is essential, requiring choline that is primarily sourced from host serum lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC). LysoPC also acts as an environmental sensor to regulate parasite sexual differentiation. Despite these critical roles for host lysoPC, the enzyme(s) involved in its breakdown to free choline for PC synthesis are unknown. Here, we show that a parasite glycerophosphodiesterase (PfGDPD) is indispensable for blood stage parasite proliferation. Exogenous choline rescues growth of PfGDPD-null parasites, directly linking PfGDPD function to choline incorporation. Genetic ablation of PfGDPD reduces choline uptake from lysoPC, resulting in depletion of several PC species in the parasite, whilst purified PfGDPD releases choline from glycerophosphocholine in vitro. Our results identify PfGDPD as a choline-releasing glycerophosphodiesterase that mediates a critical step in PC biosynthesis and parasite survival.Malaria kills over half a million people every year worldwide. A single-celled parasite called Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the most lethal form of the disease. This malaria-causing agent is carried by mosquitos which transmit the parasite to humans through their bite. Once in the bloodstream, the parasite enters red blood cells and starts to replicate so it can go on to infect other cells. Like our cells, P. falciparum is surrounded by a membrane, and further membranes surround a number of its internal compartments. To make these protective coats, the parasite has to gather a nutrient called choline to form an important building block in the membrane. The parasite gets most of its choline by absorbing and digesting a molecule known as lysoPC found in the bloodstream of its host. However, it was unclear precisely how the parasite achieves this. To address this question, Ramaprasad, Burda et al. used genetic and metabolomic approaches to study how P. falciparum breaks down lysoPC. The experiments found that mutant parasites that are unable to make an enzyme called GDPD were able to infect red blood cells, but failed to grow properly once inside the cells. The mutant parasites took up less choline and, as a result, also made fewer membrane building blocks. The team were able to rescue the mutant parasites by supplying them with large quantities of choline, which allowed them to resume growing. Taken together, the findings of Ramaprasad, Burda et al. suggest that P. falciparum uses GDPD to extract choline from lysoPC when it is living in red blood cells. More and more P. falciparum parasites are becoming resistant to many of the drugs currently being used to treat malaria. One solution is to develop new therapies that target different molecules in the parasite. Since it performs such a vital role, GDPD may have the potential to be a future drug target.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.82207\", \"publication_date\": \"2022-12-28\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4306835822\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1101/2022.10.19.512840\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 2, \"title\": \"The N-terminal executioner domains of NLR immune receptors are functionally conserved across major plant lineages\", \"abstract\": \"ABSTRACT Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins are a prominent class of intracellular immune receptors that are present across diverse plant lineages.

OM43 represents an important microbial link between marine primary production and remineralization of carbon back to the atmosphere. Bacteriophages shape microbial communities and are major drivers of mortality and global marine biogeochemistry. Recent cultivation efforts have brought the first viruses infecting members of the OM43 clade into culture. Here, we characterize a novel myophage infecting OM43 called Melnitz. Melnitz was isolated independently from water samples from a subtropical ocean gyre (Sargasso Sea) and temperate coastal (Western English Channel) systems. Metagenomic recruitment from global ocean viromes confirmed that Melnitz is globally ubiquitous, congruent with patterns of host abundance. Bacteria with streamlined genomes such as OM43 and the globally dominant SAR11 clade use riboswitches as an efficient method to regulate metabolism. Melnitz encodes a two-piece tmRNA (ssrA), controlled by a glutamine riboswitch, providing evidence that riboswitch use also occurs for regulation during phage infection of streamlined heterotrophs. Virally encoded tRNAs and ssrA found in Melnitz were phylogenetically more closely related to those found within the alphaproteobacterial SAR11 clade and their associated myophages than those within their gammaproteobacterial hosts. This suggests the possibility of an ancestral host transition event between SAR11 and OM43. Melnitz and a related myophage that infects SAR11 were unable to infect hosts of the SAR11 and OM43, respectively, suggesting host transition rather than a broadening of host range. IMPORTANCE Isolation and cultivation of viruses are the foundations on which the mechanistic understanding of virus-host interactions and parameterization of bioinformatic tools for viral ecology are based. This study isolated and characterized the first myophage known to infect the OM43 clade, expanding our knowledge of this understudied group of microbes. The nearly identical genomes of four strains of Melnitz isolated from different marine provinces and the global abundance estimations from metagenomic data suggest that this viral population is globally ubiquitous. Genome analysis revealed several unusual features in Melnitz and related genomes recovered from viromes, such as a curli operon and virally encoded tmRNA controlled by a glutamine riboswitch, neither of which are found in the host. Further phylogenetic analysis of shared genes indicates that this group of viruses infecting the gammaproteobacterial OM43 shares a recent common ancestor with viruses infecting the abundant alphaproteobacterial SAR11 clade. Host ranges are affected by compatible cell surface receptors, successful circumvention of superinfection exclusion systems, and the presence of required accessory proteins, which typically limits phages to singular narrow groups of closely related bacterial hosts.

The model learns, and assigns to each individual, topic weights for several disease topics, each of which reflects a set of diseases that tend to co-occur within individuals as a function of age. Simulations show that ATM attains high accuracy in distinguishing distinct age-dependent comorbidity profiles. We applied ATM to 282,957 UK Biobank samples, analysing 1,726,144 disease diagnoses spanning all 348 diseases with \\u22651,000 independent occurrences in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data, identifying 10 disease topics under the optimal model fit. Analysis of an independent cohort, All of Us, with 211,908 samples and 3,098,771 disease diagnoses spanning 233 of the 348 UK Biobank diseases produced highly concordant findings. In UK Biobank we identified 52 diseases with heterogeneous comorbidity profiles (\\u2265500 occurrences assigned to each of \\u22652 topics), including breast cancer, type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. For most of these diseases, topic assignments were highly age-dependent, suggesting differences in disease aetiology for early-onset vs. late-onset disease. We defined subtypes of the 52 heterogeneous diseases based on the topic assignments, and compared genetic risk across subtypes using polygenic risk scores (PRS). We identified 18 disease subtypes whose PRS differed significantly from other subtypes of the same disease, including a subtype of T2D characterised by cardiovascular comorbidities and a subtype of asthma characterised by dermatological comorbidities. We further identified specific variants underlying these differences such as a T2D-associated SNP in the HMGA2 locus that has a higher odds ratio in the top quartile of cardiovascular topic weight (1.18\\u00b10.02) compared to the bottom quartile (1.00\\u00b10.02) (P=3 \\u00d7 10 - 7 for difference, FDR = 0.0002 &lt; 0.1).

Primates encode PSKH2 in the form of a pseudokinase, which is predicted to be catalytically inactive due to loss of the invariant catalytic Asp residue. Although the biological role(s) of vertebrate PSKH2 proteins remains unclear, we previously identified species-level adaptions in PSKH2 that have led to the appearance of kinase or pseudokinase variants in vertebrate genomes alongside a canonical PSKH1 paralog.

AlphaFold 2-based structural analysis predicts functional roles for both the PSKH2 N- and C-regions that flank the pseudokinase domain core, and cellular truncation analysis confirms that the N-terminal domain, which contains a conserved myristoylation site, is required for both stable human PSKH2 expression and localisation to a membrane-rich subcellular fraction containing mitochondrial proteins. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we confirm that human PSKH2 is part of a cellular mitochondrial protein network, and that its expression is regulated through client-status within the HSP90/Cdc37 molecular chaperone system.

These differences were replicated when the corresponding tvr alleles were introduced into an RMV7 derivative lacking the locus. RNA-seq identified differential expression of the type 1 pilus, causing the variation in biofilm formation, and inhibition of competence induction in the less transformable variant, RMV7 domi . This was partly attributable to lower expression of ManLMN in RMV7 domi , which promoted competence induction through importing N -acetylglucosamine. This effect was potentiated by orthologues of the gram-negative competence regulatory machinery. Furthermore, a phage-related chromosomal island was more active in RMV7 domi , which inhibited transformation by increasing expression of the stress response proteins ClpP and HrcA. However, HrcA increased competence induction in the other variant, with its effects depending on Ca 2+ supplementation or heat shock.

A hydrophobic patch stabilizing the CoA adenine ring, while salt bridges and hydrogen bonds stabilizing the phosphate groups of CoA were observed. With molecular dynamics studies, we extended our structural analysis by characterizing the hNME1-CoA structure and elucidating possible orientations of the pantetheine tail, which is absent in the X-ray structure due to its flexibility. Crystallographic studies suggested the involvement of arginine 58 and threonine 94 in mediating specific interactions with CoA. Site-directed mutagenesis and CoA-based affinity purifications showed that arginine 58 mutation to glutamate (R58E) and threonine 94 mutation to aspartate (T94D) prevent hNME1 from binding to CoA. Overall, our results reveal a unique mode by which hNME1 binds CoA, which differs significantly from that of ADP binding: the \\u03b1- and \\u03b2-phosphates of CoA are oriented away from the nucleotide-binding site, while 3'-phosphate faces catalytic histidine 118 (H118). The interactions formed by the CoA adenine ring and phosphate groups contribute to the specific mode of CoA binding to hNME1.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24119359\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-05-27\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4280558961\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1016/j.jmb.2022.167625\", \"af_direct_citation\": 1, \"af_indirect_citations\": 8, \"title\": \"Computational Resources for Molecular Biology 2022\", \"abstract\": \"\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2022.167625\", \"publication_date\": \"2022-06-01\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4306407977\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1002/anie.202212158\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"A Vitamin B<sub>2</sub>\\u2010Photocatalysed Approach to Methionine Analogues\", \"abstract\": \"Access to new non-canonical amino acid residues is crucial for medicinal chemistry and chemical biology.

Related to this line of research, recent work on A. mellifera has shown that specific P450 enzymes belonging to the CYP9Q subfamily act as critically important determinants of insecticide sensitivity in this species by efficiently detoxifying certain insecticide chemotypes. However, the extent to which the presence of functional orthologs of these enzymes is conserved across the diversity of bees is unclear.

CHC17 performs endocytosis and housekeeping membrane traffic in all cells. CHC22, expressed most highly in skeletal muscle, transports the glucose transporter GLUT4 from the endoplasmic-reticulum-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) to an intracellular GLUT4 storage compartment (GSC) from where GLUT4 is mobilized to the plasma membrane by insulin. Here, the molecular determinants distinguishing CHC22 from CHC17 trafficking are defined. The C-terminal trimerization domain of CHC22 binds SNX5, which also binds the ERGIC tether p115. SNX5, and the functionally redundant SNX6, are required for CHC22 localization independently of their participation in the endosomal ESCPE-1 complex. In tandem, an isoform-specific patch in the CHC22 N-terminal domain separately mediates binding to p115.

Emergent proteins either fold in the periplasm or cross the peptidoglycan (PG) layer towards the outer-membrane for insertion through the \\u03b2-barrel assembly machinery (BAM). Trafficking of hydrophobic proteins through the periplasm is particularly treacherous given the high protein density and the absence of energy (ATP or chemiosmotic potential).

We propose that this immediate interaction with the enlisted chaperone helps to prevent aggregation and degradation of nascent envelope proteins, facilitating their safe passage to the periplasm and outer-membrane.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1042/bcj20220480\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-02-27\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4292295879\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1039/d2cs00387b\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 2, \"title\": \"Discovery of small molecule ligands for the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligase and their use as inhibitors and PROTAC degraders\", \"abstract\": \"The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) Cullin RING E3 ligase is an essential enzyme in the ubiquitin-proteasome system that recruits substrates such as the hypoxia inducible factor for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation.

We determined plasmid transfer from a clinical isolate, CPE16, which carried four plasmids, including the 119-kbp bla NDM-1 -bearing F-type plasmid pCPE16_3, in planktonic and biofilm conditions. We found that transfer frequency of pCPE16_3 in a biofilm was orders-of-magnitude higher than between planktonic cells. In 5/7 sequenced transconjugants multiple plasmids had transferred. Plasmid acquisition had no detectable growth impact on transconjugants. Gene expression of the recipient and a transconjugant was investigated by RNA-sequencing in three lifestyles: planktonic exponential growth, planktonic stationary phase, and biofilm. We found that lifestyle had a substantial impact on chromosomal gene expression, and plasmid carriage affected chromosomal gene expression most in stationary planktonic and biofilm lifestyles. Furthermore, expression of plasmid genes was lifestyle-dependent, with unique signatures across the three conditions. Our study shows that growth in biofilm greatly increased the risk of conjugative transfer of a carbapenem resistance plasmid in K. pneumoniae without fitness costs and minimal transcriptional rearrangements, thus highlighting the importance of biofilms in the spread of AMR in this opportunistic pathogen. Importance Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae is particularly problematic in hospital settings. Carbapenem resistance genes can transfer between bacteria via plasmid conjugation. Alongside drug resistance, K. pneumoniae can form biofilms on hospital surfaces, at infection sites and on implanted devices.

Cytokinetic abscission is mediated by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT), a conserved membrane remodelling machinery. The midbody organiser CEP55 recruits early acting ESCRT factors such as ESCRT-I and ALIX (also known as PDCD6IP), which subsequently initiate the formation of ESCRT-III polymers that sever the midbody. We now identify UMAD1 as an ESCRT-I subunit that facilitates abscission. UMAD1 selectively associates with VPS37C and VPS37B, supporting the formation of cytokinesis-specific ESCRT-I assemblies. TSG101 recruits UMAD1 to the site of midbody abscission, to stabilise the CEP55\\u2013ESCRT-I interaction. We further demonstrate that the UMAD1\\u2013ESCRT-I interaction facilitates the final step of cytokinesis. Paradoxically, UMAD1 and ALIX co-depletion has synergistic effects on abscission, whereas ESCRT-III recruitment to the midbody is not inhibited.

Therefore, UMAD1 reveals a key functional connection between ESCRT-I and ESCRT-III that is required for cytokinesis.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.261097\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-08-01\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4385064620\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1038/s41467-023-40125-z\", \"af_direct_citation\": 1, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"Mapping diversity in African trypanosomes using high resolution spatial proteomics\", \"abstract\": \"African trypanosomes are dixenous eukaryotic parasites that impose a significant human and veterinary disease burden on sub-Saharan Africa.

Composition of the proteome is controlled by diverse processes affecting protein translocation and degradation-our focus here. Most chloroplast proteins are imported from the cytosol via multiprotein translocons in the outer and inner envelope membranes (the TOC and TIC complexes, respectively), or via one of several noncanonical pathways, and then sorted by different systems to organellar subcompartments. Chloroplast proteolysis is equally complex, involving the concerted action of internal proteases of prokaryotic origin and the nucleocytosolic ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). The UPS degrades unimported proteins in the cytosol and chloroplast-resident proteins via chloroplast-associated protein degradation (CHLORAD). The latter targets the TOC apparatus to regulate protein import, as well as numerous internal proteins directly, to reconfigure chloroplast functions in response to developmental and environmental signals.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-arplant-070122-032532\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-05-22\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4308878080\", \"doi_x\": \"10.3389/fendo.2022.1031013\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"Identification of unusual oxysterols biosynthesised in human pregnancy by charge-tagging and liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry\", \"abstract\": \"The aim of this study was to identify oxysterols and any down-stream metabolites in placenta, umbilical cord blood plasma, maternal plasma and amniotic fluid to enhance our knowledge of the involvement of these molecules in pregnancy.

NLRP3 (see Glossary) inflammasome is an intracellular protein complex that has emerged as a key mediator of inflammation in many pathologies. NLRP3 activation by microbes and danger signals (Figure 1) leads to the release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\\u03b2 and IL-18, as well as to GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis, a proinflammatory type of cell death (Box 1).Box 1Pyroptosis: a gasdermin-meditated type of inflammatory cell deathPyroptosis is a type of programmed necrotic cell death characterized by the permeabilization of the plasma membrane by gasdermin protein family members, leading to the subsequent release of intracellular contents (for recent review, see [4.Broz P. et al.The gasdermins, a protein family executing cell death and inflammation.Nat.

The presence of cytosolic constituents in the extracellular milieu is a signal that the innate immune system recognizes through specific receptors that elicit an inflammatory response aimed to repair tissue damage. For example, proinflammatory cytokines of the IL-1 family, such as the alarmin IL-1\\u03b2, lack a signal peptide and, thus, their cellular release requires permeabilization of the plasma membrane [112.Chan A.H.

Gasdermins are an evolutionary conserved family of proteins that share two well-defined structural domains: an N-terminal domain with intrinsic pore-forming properties and a C-terminal domain that represses the pore-forming activities of the N-terminal domain, connected by a linker sequence [4.Broz P. et al.The gasdermins, a protein family executing cell death and inflammation.Nat.

The past 5 years have seen rapid progress in the development of small-molecule inhibitors targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, with several NLRP3 and GSDMD inhibitors alleviating pathology in more than 100 preclinical disease models [1.Corcoran S.E. et al.Pharmacological inhibition of the nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome with MCC950.Pharmacol.

Drug Discov. 2018; 17: 588-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] (Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 2). These promising findings have fueled the rapid progression of NLRP3 inhibitors through human trials toward the clinic (Box 2), with GSDMD inhibitors closely following. Thus, it is both important and timely to review the landscape of emerging inflammasome drug candidates and their potential clinical applications. It is becoming particularly pressing to understand which inflammasome inhibitors to prioritize for trials in specific disease indications. Here, we discuss priority disease areas for NLRP3 inflammasome blockers, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of directly blocking the inflammasome (via NLRP3 inhibition) versus suppressing GSDMD-induced pyroptosis.Table 1NLRP3 inhibitorsaAbbreviations: AKT kinase, protein kinase B; DSS, dextran sulfate sodium; EAE, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; FAK1, focal adhesion kinase 1; HSF1, heat shock factor 1; Hsp72, heat shock protein 72; JAK, Janus kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; N/A, not applicable; NAFLD, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; ND, Not determined ; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; RPL10, ribosomal protein L10; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; SYK, spleen tyrosine kinase; TBI, traumatic brain injury; TGF-\\u03b2, transforming growth factor-\\u03b2; TRPV2, transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 2; USP, ubiquitin-specific protease.

IFM Tre was acquired by Novartis in 2019, and their molecule IFM 2427 (later named DFV890) has reportedly completed Phase I safety trials. DFV890 will be tested in Phase II trials for the CAPS subtype familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (NCT04868968) and knee osteoarthritis (NCT04886258). DFV890 has completed a Phase II trial for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia (NCT04382053). DFV890 administrated to patients with impaired respiratory function because of COVID-19 pneumonia had no effect on disease severity as measured by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, serum C-reactive protein levels, clinical status, or requirement for mechanical ventilation. Inflazome tested two molecules in Phase I trials. Inzomelid (IZD174; NCT04086602) is a brain-penetrant molecule, whereas Somalix (IZD334) is peripherally restricted and was tested in a Phase I and a Phase IB trial in CAPS (NCT04015076). No results from these trials have been released, but Roche acquired Inflazome in 2020i and Phase II trials might be initiated in the near future. In June 2020, NodTheraii announced a Phase I trial with their NLRP3 inhibitor NT-0167, but no further information on this trial is available.

The inflammasome pathway is an important innate immune effector mechanism triggered in response to infection and tissue injury. Inflammasomes elicit an inflammatory response that aims to eliminate invading pathogens and repair damaged tissues, restoring homeostasis. Inflammasome assembly involves a series of protein oligomerization events induced after the recognition of specific molecular patterns from pathogens, cell damage, or altered homeostatic conditions, resulting in the formation of large multiprotein signaling platforms that activate the protease caspase-1 (Figure 1). The best-described inflammasomes are formed by the following sensor proteins: (i) nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain with leucine-rich repeat (NLR) and pyrin domain-containing 1 (NLRP1); (ii) NLRP3 (Figure 1); (iii) NLRP6; (iv) NLR family apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP), which functions in concert with the NLR family, caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD)-containing 4 (NLRC4); (v) absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2); and (vi) Pyrin (PYD) [3.Christgen S. et al.Toward targeting inflammasomes: insights into their regulation and activation.Cell Res. 2020; 30: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar]. These inflammasome sensor proteins recognize distinct perturbations of homeostasis and form oligomers able to recruit the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) into the inflammasome through PYD\\u2013PYD or CARD\\u2013CARD homotypic domain interactions (Figure 1). ASC then oligomerizes to form helical filaments in which the zymogen pro-caspase-1 is recruited via CARD\\u2013CARD domain interactions to favor its activation [3.Christgen S. et al.Toward targeting inflammasomes: insights into their regulation and activation.Cell Res. 2020; 30: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar]. Caspase-1 subsequently induces the proteolytic maturation of proinflammatory cytokines of the IL-1 family, such as IL-1\\u03b2 and IL-18 (Figure 1) [3.Christgen S. et al.Toward targeting inflammasomes: insights into their regulation and activation.Cell Res. 2020; 30: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar]. Caspase-1 also processes the protein GSDMD, which releases its lytic N-terminal domain (N-GSDMD), which binds to the plasma membrane and oligomerizes to form pores, allowing the release of mature IL-1\\u03b2 and IL-18 (Figure 1). If the burden of plasma membrane pores is sufficiently high, this results in a proinflammatory necrotic type of cell death called pyroptosis (Box 1) [4.Broz P. et al.The gasdermins, a protein family executing cell death and inflammation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar]. During pyroptosis, the release of intracellular contents, including inflammasome oligomers, amplifies the inflammatory response and contributes to inflammatory pathology [5.Baroja-Mazo A. et al.The NLRP3 inflammasome is released as a particulate danger signal that amplifies the inflammatory response.Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar]. Among inflammasomes, the NLRP3 inflammasome is the most promiscuous, because it can be activated in response to diverse triggers, including pathogen- and danger-associated molecular patterns.

Although rigorous determination of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity remains elusive, owing to the continuous evolution of the virus, steps have been made to understand its genome, structure, and emerging genetic mutations. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is composed of several open reading frames and structural proteins, including the spike protein, which is essential for entry into host cells.

The method extends current capabilities of reduced-order models to generalise, i.e., to make predictions for unseen scenarios. The method is applied to a 2D test case which simulates the chaotic time-dependent flow of air past buildings at a moderate Reynolds number using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code. The procedure for 3D problems is similar, however, a 2D test case is considered sufficient here, as a proof-of-concept. The reduced-order model consists of a sampling technique to obtain the snapshots; a convolutional autoencoder for dimensionality reduction; an adversarial network for prediction; all set within a domain decomposition framework. The autoencoder is chosen for dimensionality reduction as it has been demonstrated in the literature that these networks can compress information more efficiently than traditional (linear) approaches based on singular value decomposition. In order to keep the predictions realistic, properties of adversarial networks are exploited. To demonstrate its ability to generalise, once trained, the method is applied to a larger domain which has a different arrangement of buildings.

The first serves to mediate infection, and the second, which appears later, serves as sophisticated intracellular nutrient exchange interfaces. The overlap in both the signaling pathways and downstream infection components of these symbioses reflects their evolutionary relatedness and the common requirements of these two interactions.

Investigation of pH dependence generally proceeds by mutagenesis of a wide set of amino acids, guided by properties such as amino-acid conservation and structure. Prediction of pKas can streamline this process, allowing rapid and effective identification of amino acids of interest with respect to pH dependence. Commencing with the calcium-activated chloride channel bestrophin 1, the carboxylate ligand structure around calcium sites relaxes in the absence of calcium, consistent with a measured lack of pH dependence. By contrast, less relaxation in the absence of calcium in TMEM16A, and maintenance of elevated carboxylate sidechain pKas, is suggested to give rise to pH-dependent chloride channel activity. This hypothesis, modulation of calcium/proton coupling and pH-dependent activity through the extent of structural relaxation, is shown to apply to the well-characterised cytosolic proteins calmodulin (pH-independent) and calbindin D9k (pH-dependent). Further application of destabilised, ionisable charge sites, or electrostatic frustration, is made to other human chloride channels (that are not calcium-activated), ClC-2, GABAA, and GlyR. Experimentally determined sites of pH modulation are readily identified. Structure-based tools for pKa prediction are freely available, allowing users to focus on mutagenesis studies, construct hypothetical proton pathways, and derive hypotheses such as the model for control of pH-dependent calcium activation through structural flexibility.

A survey of the genes encoding inorganic N transporters and the sensing and assimilatory families in pea, revealed similar numbers of genes encoding the primary N assimilatory enzymes to those in other types of plants. Interestingly, we find that pea and Medicago truncatula have fewer members of the NRT2 nitrate transporter family. We suggest that this difference may result from a decreased dependency on soil nitrate acquisition, as legumes have the capacity to derive N from a symbiotic relationship with diazotrophs. Comparison with M. truncatula, indicates that only one of three NRT2s in pea is likely to be functional, possibly indicating less N uptake before nodule formation and N-fixation starts. Pea seeds are large, containing generous amounts of N-rich storage proteins providing a reserve that helps seedling establishment and this may also explain why fewer high affinity nitrate transporters are required. The capacity for nitrate accumulation in the vacuole is another component of assimilation, as it can provide a storage reservoir that supplies the plant when soil N is depleted. Comparing published pea tissue nitrate concentrations with other plants, we find that there is less accumulation of nitrate, even in non-nodulated plants, and that suggests a lower capacity for vacuolar storage. The long-distance transported form of organic N in the phloem is known to be specialized in legumes, with increased amounts of organic N molecules transported, like ureides, allantoin, asparagine and amides in pea. We suggest that, in general, the lower tissue and phloem nitrate levels compared with non-legumes may also result in less requirement for high affinity nitrate transporters. The pattern of N transporter and assimilatory enzyme distribution in pea is discussed and compared with non-legumes with the aim of identifying future breeding targets.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.3390/genes13010158\", \"publication_date\": \"2022-01-17\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4220723714\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1111/febs.16422\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"The intricate balance between microRNA\\u2010induced mRNA decay and translational repression\", \"abstract\": \"Post-transcriptional regulation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) (i.e., mechanisms that control translation, stability and localization) is a critical focal point in spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression in response to changes in environmental conditions.

This makes such transporters valuable both as a means of targeting drugs (not least anti-infectives) to selected cells or tissues and also as drug targets. The same considerations apply to the exploitation of substrate uptake and product efflux transporters in biotechnology.

To examine the ANGPTL mechanisms for plasma lipid modulation in humans, we pursued a genetic mimicry analysis of enhancing or suppressing variants in the LPL, LIPG, lipase C hepatic type (LIPC), ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4, and ANGPTL8 genes using data on 248 metabolic parameters derived from over 110,000 nonfasted individuals in the UK Biobank and validated in over 13,000 overnight fasted individuals from 11 other European populations. ANGPTL4 suppression was highly concordant with LPL enhancement but not HL or EL, suggesting ANGPTL4 impacts plasma metabolic parameters exclusively via LPL. The LPL-independent effects of ANGPTL3 suppression on plasma metabolic parameters showed a striking inverse resemblance with EL suppression, suggesting ANGPTL3 not only targets LPL but also targets EL. Investigation of the impact of the ANGPTL3-ANGPTL8 complex on plasma metabolite traits via the ANGPTL8 R59W substitution as an instrumental variable showed a much higher concordance between R59W and EL activity than between R59W and LPL activity, suggesting the R59W substitution more strongly affects EL inhibition than LPL inhibition.

Here, we measure the susceptibility of 64 strains of Staphylococcaceae bacteria (48 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 16 non-S. aureus species spanning 2 genera) to the bacteriophage ISP, which is currently under investigation for use in phage therapy.

We find positive correlations between susceptibility assessed using OD and qPCR and variable correlations between plaque assays and either OD or qPCR, suggesting that plaque assays alone may be inadequate to assess host range.

We therefore aimed to characterise the sensitivity of the omicron variant to neutralisation.For this cross-sectional study, we cloned the sequence encoding the omicron spike protein from a diagnostic sample to establish an omicron pseudotyped virus neutralisation assay. We quantified the neutralising antibody ID50 (the reciprocal dilution that produces 50% inhibition) against the omicron spike protein, and the fold-change in ID50 relative to the spike of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (ie, the pandemic founder variant), for one convalescent reference plasma pool (WHO International Standard for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin [20/136]), three reference serum pools from vaccinated individuals, and two cohorts from Stockholm, Sweden: one comprising previously infected hospital workers (17 sampled in November, 2021, after vaccine rollout and nine in June or July, 2020, before vaccination) and one comprising serum from 40 randomly sampled blood donors donated during week 48 (Nov 29-Dec 5) of 2021. Furthermore, we assessed the neutralisation of omicron by five clinically relevant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).Neutralising antibody responses in reference sample pools sampled shortly after infection or vaccination were substantially less potent against the omicron variant than against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (seven-fold to 42-fold reduction in ID50 titres). Similarly, for sera obtained before vaccination in 2020 from a cohort of convalescent hospital workers, neutralisation of the omicron variant was low to undetectable (all ID50 titres <20). However, in serum samples obtained in 2021 from two cohorts in Stockholm, substantial cross-neutralisation of the omicron variant was observed. Sera from 17 hospital workers after infection and subsequent vaccination had a reduction in average potency of only five-fold relative to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (geometric mean ID50 titre 495 vs 105), and two donors had no reduction in potency. A similar pattern was observed in randomly sampled blood donors (n=40), who had an eight-fold reduction in average potency against the omicron variant compared with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (geometric mean ID50 titre 369 vs 45). We found that the omicron variant was resistant to neutralisation (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] >10 \\u03bcg/mL) by mAbs casirivimab (REGN-10933), imdevimab (REGN-10987), etesevimab (Ly-CoV016), and bamlanivimab (Ly-CoV555), which form part of antibody combinations used in the clinic to treat COVID-19.

Biochemical and single-molecule analyses showed that BCDX2 stimulates the nucleation and extension of RAD51 filaments-which are essential for recombinational DNA repair-in reactions that depend on the coupled ATPase activities of RAD51B and RAD51C. Our studies demonstrate that BCDX2 orchestrates RAD51 assembly on single stranded DNA for replication fork protection and double strand break repair, in reactions that are critical for tumour avoidance.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06179-1\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-06-21\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4200264790\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1101/2021.12.12.472321\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"Insights into the role of lipoteichoic acids and MprF function in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>\", \"abstract\": \"Abstract Gram-positive bacterial cells are protected from the environment by a cell envelope which comprises of layers of peptidoglycan that maintain the cell shape and teichoic acids polymers whose biological function remains unclear.

Using electron microscopy, we also showed that SD was associated with a general increase in the density of ER cisternae in pyramidal neurons of the motor cortex. Moreover, ER cisternae established new contact sites with mitochondria, the so-called mitochondria associated membranes (MAMs), important hubs for molecule shuttling, such as calcium and lipids, and for the modulation of ATP production and redox state. Finally, we demonstrated that Drosophila male mutant flies (elav > linker), in which the number of MAMs had been genetically increased, showed a reduction in the amount and consolidation of sleep without alterations in the homeostatic sleep response to SD.We provide evidence that sleep loss induces ER stress characterized by increased crosstalk between ER and mitochondria.

Often, X-ray crystallography FBLD pipelines either choose the polymorph based on cell volume and point-group symmetry of the X-ray diffraction data or leave polymorph attribution to manual intervention on the part of the user. Thus, when the FBLD crystals belong to more than one crystal polymorph, the discovery pipeline can be plagued by space group ambiguity, especially if the polymorphs at hand are variations of the same lattice and, therefore, difficult to tell apart from their morphology and/or their apparent crystal lattices and point groups. In the course of a fragment-based lead discovery effort aimed at finding ligands of the catalytic domain of UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT), we encountered a mixture of trigonal crystals and pseudotrigonal triclinic crystals-with the two lattices closely related. In order to resolve that polymorphism ambiguity, we have written and described here a series of Unix shell scripts called CoALLA (crystal polymorph and ligand likelihood-based assignment). The CoALLA scripts are written in Unix shell and use autoPROC for data processing, CCP4-Dimple/REFMAC5 and BUSTER for refinement, and RHOFIT for ligand docking. The choice of the polymorph is effected by carrying out (in each of the known polymorphs) the tasks of diffraction data indexing, integration, scaling, and structural refinement. The most likely polymorph is then chosen as the one with the best structure refinement Rfree statistic. The CoALLA scripts further implement a likelihood-based ligand assignment strategy, starting with macromolecular refinement and automated water addition, followed by removal of the water molecules that appear to be fitting ligand density, and a final round of refinement after random perturbation of the refined macromolecular model, in order to obtain unbiased difference density maps for automated ligand placement.

High-throughput sequencing, from single PCR targets through to the analysis of whole genomes, offers significant promise towards providing information-rich data that may add value beyond traditional and conventional molecular approaches; however, thus far, its utility has not been fully explored to detect helminths in faecal samples. In this study, low-depth whole genome sequencing, i.e. genome skimming, has been applied to detect and characterise helminth diversity in a set of helminth-infected human and livestock faecal material. The strengths and limitations of this approach are evaluated using three methods to characterise and differentiate metagenomic sequencing data based on (i) mapping to whole mitochondrial genomes, (ii) whole genome assemblies, and (iii) a comprehensive internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) database, together with validation using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Our analyses suggest that genome skimming can successfully identify most single and multi-species infections reported by qPCR and can provide sufficient coverage within some samples to resolve consensus mitochondrial genomes, thus facilitating phylogenetic analyses of selected genera, e.g. Ascaris spp. Key to this approach is both the availability and integrity of helminth reference genomes, some of which are currently contaminated with bacterial and host sequences.

The proteolytic processing and glycosylation of ECM components is vital to their function. These modifications are under the control of the Golgi apparatus, an intracellular factory hosting spatially organised, protein-modifying enzymes.

Variants of concern (VOCs) have emerged which may affect transmissibility, disease severity and re-infection risk. Most studies focus on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein. However, some studies suggest that the Spike N-terminal domain (NTD) may have a role in facilitating virus entry via sialic-acid receptor binding. Furthermore, most VOCs include novel NTD variants. Recent analyses demonstrated that NTD insertions in VOCs tend to lie close to loop regions likely to be involved in binding sialic acids. We extended the structural characterisation of these putative sugar binding pockets and explored whether variants could enhance the binding to sialic acids and therefore to the host membrane, thereby contributing to increased transmissibility. We found that recent NTD insertions in VOCs (i.e., Gamma, Delta and Omicron variants) and emerging variants of interest (VOIs) (i.e., Iota, Lambda, Theta variants) frequently lie close to known and putative sugar-binding pockets. For some variants, including the recent Omicron VOC, we find increases in predicted sialic acid binding energy, compared to the original SARS-CoV-2, which may contribute to increased transmission. We examined the similarity of NTD across a range of related Betacoronaviruses to determine whether the putative sugar-binding pockets are sufficiently similar to be exploited in drug design. Despite global sequence and structure similarity, most sialic-acid binding pockets of NTD vary across related coronaviruses. Typically, SARS-CoV-2 possesses additional loops in these pockets that increase contact with polysaccharides. Our work suggests ongoing evolutionary tuning of the sugar-binding pockets in the virus. Whilst three of the pockets are too structurally variable to be amenable to pan Betacoronavirus drug design, we detected a fourth pocket that is highly structurally conserved and could therefore be investigated in pursuit of a generic drug. Our structure-based analyses help rationalise the effects of VOCs and provide hypotheses for experiments. For example, the Omicron variant, which has increased binding to sialic acids in pocket 3, has a rather unique insertion near pocket 3. Our work suggests a strong need for experimental monitoring of VOC changes in NTD.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.06.471394\", \"publication_date\": \"2021-12-07\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4318042259\", \"doi_x\": \"10.3390/biology12020181\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"Macromolecular Crowding Is Surprisingly Unable to Deform the Structure of a Model Biomolecular Condensate\", \"abstract\": \"The crowded interior of a living cell makes performing experiments on simpler in vitro systems attractive.

A topical example is the phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins into biomolecular condensates, which is proposed to underlie the membrane-less compartmentalization of many cellular functions. How a cell reliably controls biochemical reactions in compartments open to the compositionally-varying cytoplasm is an important question for understanding cellular homeostasis. Computer simulations are often used to study the phase behavior of model biomolecular condensates, but the number of relevant parameters increases as the number of protein components increases. It is unfeasible to exhaustively simulate such models for all parameter combinations, although interesting phenomena are almost certainly hidden in their high-dimensional parameter space. Here, we have studied the phase behavior of a model biomolecular condensate in the presence of a polymeric crowding agent. We used a novel compute framework to execute dozens of simultaneous simulations spanning the protein/crowder concentration space. We then combined the results into a graphical representation for human interpretation, which provided an efficient way to search the model\\u2019s high-dimensional parameter space. We found that steric repulsion from the crowder drives a near-critical system across the phase boundary, but the molecular arrangement within the resulting biomolecular condensate is rather insensitive to the crowder concentration and molecular weight.

While confirming that TALE increases HOX specificity and selectivity in vivo, this wider outlook also reveals novel aspects of HOX:TALE collaboration, namely that HOX TFs generally require pre-bound TALE factors to access their functional binding sites in vivo. In contrast to the restricted expression domains of HOX TFs, TALE factors are largely ubiquitous, and PBX and PREP are expressed at the earliest developmental stages. PBX and MEIS control development of many organs and tissues and their dysregulation is associated with congenital disease and cancer. Accordingly, many instances of TALE cooperation with non HOX TFs have been documented in various systems. The model that emerges from these studies is that TALE TFs create a permissive chromatin platform that is selected by tissue-restricted TFs for binding. In turn, HOX and other tissue-restricted TFs selectively convert a ubiquitous pool of low affinity TALE binding events into high confidence, tissue-restricted binding events associated with transcriptional activation. As a result, TALE:TF complexes are associated with active chromatin and domain/lineage-specific gene activity.

In this Review, we define some of the key concepts of how this machinery functions, highlighting the critical requirement for mechanosensory proteins, and conceptualise the coupling of mechanical linkages to mechanochemical switches that enables forces to be converted into biological signals. These mechanical couplings provide a mechanism for how mechanical crosstalk might coordinate the entire cell, its neighbours, extending into whole collections of cells, in tissues and in organs, and ultimately in the coordination and operation of entire organisms. Consequently, many diseases manifest through defects in this machinery, which we map onto schematics of the mechanical linkages within a cell.

Investigation of pH-dependence generally proceeds by mutagenesis of a wide set of amino acids, guided by properties such as amino acid conservation and structure. This study shows how web-based calculation of pKas allows rapid and effective identification of amino acids of interest with respect to pH-dependence. Commencing with the calcium-activated chloride channel bestrophin 1, the carboxylate ligand structure around calcium sites relaxes in the absence of calcium, consistent with a measured lack of pH-dependence. By contrast, less relaxation in the absence of calcium in TMEM16A, and maintenance of elevated carboxylate sidechain pKas, is suggested to give rise to pH-dependent chloride channel activity. This hypothesis, modulation of calcium/proton coupling and pH-dependent activity through extent of structural relaxation, is shown to apply to the well-characterised cytosolic proteins calmodulin (pH-independent) and calbindin D 9k (pH-dependent). Further application of destabilised ionisable charge sites, or electrostatic frustration, is made to other human chloride channels (that are not calcium-activated), ClC-2, GABA A , and GlyR. Experimentally-determined sites of pH modulation are readily identified. The structure-based tool is freely available, allowing users to focus mutagenesis studies, construct hypothetical proton pathways, and derive hypotheses such as the model for control of pH-dependent calcium activation through structural flexibility.

We have taken advantage of this unique anatomical structure to establish proteome and phosphoproteome dynamics in neuronal cell bodies and axonal terminals in response to physiological stimulation. We have found that proteome and phosphoproteome responses to neuronal stimulation are very different between somatic and axonal neuronal compartments, indicating the need of each cell domain to differentially adapt. In particular, changes in the phosphoproteome in the cell body are involved in the reorganization of the cytoskeleton and in axonal terminals the regulation of synaptic and secretory processes. We have identified that prohormone precursors including vasopressin and oxytocin are phosphorylated in axonal terminals and are hyperphosphorylated following stimulation.

The downstream changes mediated by an effector's enzymatic activity range from highly specific to multifunctional, and altogether their combined action impacts the function of an impressive array of host cellular processes, including signal transduction, membrane trafficking, and both innate and adaptive immune responses. Salmonella and related Gram-negative pathogens have been a rich resource for the discovery of unique enzymatic activities, expanding our understanding of host signalling networks, bacterial pathogenesis as well as basic biochemistry. In this review, we provide an up-to-date assessment of host manipulation mediated by the Salmonella type III secretion system injectosome, exploring the cellular effects of diverse effector activities with a particular focus on PTMs and the implications for infection outcomes.

Whether thermal selection of enzymes explains marine microbiome plasticity in response to temperature remains unresolved. By quantifying the thermal behaviour of seven functionally-independent enzyme classes (esterase, extradiol dioxygenase, phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, nuclease, transaminase, and aldo-keto reductase) in native proteomes of marine sediment microbiomes from the Irish Sea to the southern Red Sea, we record a significant effect of the mean annual temperature (MAT) on enzyme response in all cases. Activity and stability profiles of 228 esterases and 5 extradiol dioxygenases from sediment and seawater across 70 locations worldwide validate this thermal pattern. Modelling the esterase phase transition temperature as a measure of structural flexibility confirms the observed relationship with MAT. Furthermore, when considering temperature variability in sites with non-significantly different MATs, the broadest range of enzyme thermal behaviour and the highest growth plasticity of the enriched heterotrophic bacteria occur in samples with the widest annual thermal variability. These results indicate that temperature-driven enzyme selection shapes microbiome thermal plasticity and that thermal variability finely tunes such processes and should be considered alongside MAT in forecasting microbial community thermal response.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36610-0\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-02-24\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4303614299\", \"doi_x\": \"10.3390/biom12101425\", \"af_direct_citation\": 1, \"af_indirect_citations\": 13, \"title\": \"Protein Data Bank: A Comprehensive Review of 3D Structure Holdings and Worldwide Utilization by Researchers, Educators, and Students\", \"abstract\": \"The Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB), funded by the United States National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and Department of Energy, supports structural biologists and Protein Data Bank (PDB) data users around the world.

Phenotypic maps can inform the prediction of concerning mutations from genomic surveillance, however most of these maps currently derive from studies using monomeric RBD, while spike is trimeric, and contains additional domains. These maps may fail to reflect interdomain interactions in the prediction of phenotypes. To try to improve on this, we developed a platform for deep mutational scanning using whole trimeric spike. We confirmed a previously reported epistatic effect within the RBD affecting ACE2 binding, that highlights the importance of updating the base spike sequence for future mutational scanning studies. Using post vaccine sera, we found that the immune response of vaccinated individuals was highly focused on one or two epitopes in the RBD and that single point mutations at these positions can account for most of the immune escape mediated by the Omicron BA.1 RBD. However, unexpectedly we found that the BA.1 RBD alone does not account for the high level of antigenic escape by BA.1 spike. We show that the BA.1 NTD amplifies the immune evasion of its associated RBD. BA.1 NTD reduces neutralistion by RBD directed monoclonal antibodies, and impacts ACE2 interaction. NTD variation is thus an important mechanism of immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2. Such effects are not seen when pre-stabilized spike proteins are used, suggesting the interdomain effects require protein mobility to express their phenotype.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1011545\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-08-03\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4205929130\", \"doi_x\": \"10.1038/s41592-021-01361-7\", \"af_direct_citation\": 1, \"af_indirect_citations\": 8, \"title\": \"A paradigm shift in structural biology\", \"abstract\": \"The release of protein structure predictions from AlphaFold will increase the number of protein structural models by almost three orders of magnitude.

Severe COVID-19 is characterised in part by vascular thrombosis and a cytokine storm due to increased plasma concentrations of factors secreted from endothelial and T-cells. Here, using patient data recorded in the UK Biobank, we demonstrate the importance of variations in Rab46 (CRACR2A) with clinical outcomes. Using logistic regression analysis, we determined that three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene EFCAB4B cause missense mutations in Rab46, which are associated with COVID-19 fatality independently of risk factors. All three SNPs cause changes in amino acid residues that are highly conserved across species, indicating their importance in protein structure and function. Two SNPs, rs17836273 (A98T) and rs36030417 (H212Q), cause amino acid substitutions in important functional domains: the EF-hand and coiled-coil domain respectively. By using molecular modelling, we suggest that the substitution of threonine at position 98 causes structural changes in the EF-hand calcium binding domain. Since Rab46 is a Rab GTPase that regulates both endothelial cell secretion and T-cell signalling, these missense variations may play a role in the molecular mechanisms underlying the thrombotic and inflammatory characteristics observed in patients with severe COVID-19 outcomes.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.17.22269412\", \"publication_date\": \"2022-01-17\"}, {\"work_id\": \"W4383217220\", \"doi_x\": \"10.3389/fpls.2023.1230278\", \"af_direct_citation\": 0, \"af_indirect_citations\": 1, \"title\": \"Mechanisms of prezygotic post-pollination reproductive barriers in plants\", \"abstract\": \"Hybridisation between individuals of different species can lead to maladapted or inviable progeny due to genetic incompatibilities between diverging species. On the other hand, mating with close relatives, or self-fertilisation may lead to inbreeding depression. Thus, both too much or too little divergence may lead to problems and the organisms have to carefully choose mating partners to avoid both of these pitfalls. In plants this choice occurs at many stages during reproduction, but pollen-pistil interactions play a particularly important role in avoiding inbreeding and hybridisation with other species. Interestingly, the mechanisms involved in avoidance of selfing and interspecific hybridisation may work via shared molecular pathways, as self-incompatible species tend to be more 'choosy' with heterospecific pollen compared to self-compatible ones. This review discusses various prezygotic post-pollination barriers to interspecific hybridisation, with a focus on the mechanisms of pollen-pistil interactions and their role in the maintenance of species integrity.\", \"doi_y\": \"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1230278\", \"publication_date\": \"2023-07-05\"}]}}, {\"mode\": \"vega-lite\"});\n",
